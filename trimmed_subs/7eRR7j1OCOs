00:00:02 hello allie
00:00:03 oh you look at it you fired up the vape
00:00:04 is it the vape i brought you two
00:00:06 cigarettes two jewels and camels
00:00:09 coffee and a smoothie i wasn't sure what
00:00:11 to expect
00:00:12 what would you what was your worst case
00:00:14 scenario oh my god worst case scenario i
00:00:16 poop my pants right off the bat
00:00:18 oh have you done that before like when
00:00:19 you get nervous not when i get nervous
00:00:21 but i used to
00:00:22 well only once in college you pooped
00:00:25 your pants yeah i was
00:00:26 drinking yeah i was hungover i ate
00:00:27 chipotle i ate chipotle pretty much
00:00:29 every
00:00:30 day in college that's uh not good for
00:00:32 you not good at all trying to learn
00:00:34 yeah actually chipotle like those bowls
00:00:36 they are pretty good
00:00:37 they're so good like if you get like one
00:00:39 of those steak bowls with rice like
00:00:40 that's about as clean as you can eat
00:00:42 yeah and in college it was nice because
00:00:45 you could eat like half of a bowl and be
00:00:47 like super full and then eat the other
00:00:49 half later
00:00:50 and you can do the tricks of getting
00:00:52 half steak half
00:00:53 chicken or something that way they give
00:00:55 you more oh is that a trick i don't
00:00:56 think it is a trick i think they have
00:00:57 like a scooper
00:00:58 they have a scooper but if you say you
00:01:00 want half this and half that
00:01:02 they're not going to put half in the
00:01:04 scooper they're putting a full scooper
00:01:05 in there
00:01:06 and then you're getting a full pooper on
00:01:07 the couch in college
00:01:09 yeah sorry to hear about the poop in the
00:01:11 pants it's all right
00:01:13 people are very embarrassed about that
00:01:14 but it does happen if you take chances i
00:01:15 feel like it happens to every everyone
00:01:17 has a poop story
00:01:18 i hope if you don't i feel like you're
00:01:20 just not taking enough chances with your
00:01:22 diet
00:01:23 no and it's like i think everyone's poop
00:01:25 story starts out with them being like oh
00:01:27 i thought i was gonna fart
00:01:29 and then it was not a fart yeah that's
00:01:31 in the car that's when it happens
00:01:32 i was honestly on the drive up here i
00:01:35 had a little bit of gas and i was like
00:01:37 just wait until you're there
00:01:39 hold it because you don't want to take
00:01:41 any risks right now
00:01:42 yeah so i you know it actually worked
00:01:45 out i let it out
00:01:46 i've had a pot there was a podcast once
00:01:48 where i legitimately thought do you
00:01:49 remember who it was i legitimately
00:01:51 thought i was gonna shit my pants
00:01:52 i was like pinching my my abs down
00:01:55 i was like crunching myself like listen
00:01:57 if i don't get out of here right now
00:01:59 i don't know if i'm gonna make it i do
00:02:01 you remember who it was but
00:02:02 i might even set it on the air yeah i
00:02:04 remember it happening but i don't
00:02:05 remember
00:02:06 who was in the room i barely got out
00:02:08 it's kind of a nice feeling though i
00:02:09 like that like adrenaline rush of like i
00:02:12 need to hold like
00:02:13 it really tests my skills like cramming
00:02:15 for a test yeah
00:02:16 like oh my god there's not much time
00:02:18 left yeah i i dropped out of college so
00:02:20 like i feel like me
00:02:21 trying to hold in a poop is the most
00:02:23 cramming for a test i feel like i do
00:02:25 why that is a psychological thing the
00:02:27 cramming thing
00:02:28 they say that some people like
00:02:29 procrastinate until they know
00:02:31 they just they have to like okay i'm
00:02:34 gonna stay up all night i'm a
00:02:35 procrastinator
00:02:36 yeah always most comics are you think so
00:02:39 yeah yeah i think there's something look
00:02:41 we're all broken we're all broken toys
00:02:43 and most most comics um there's
00:02:46 something about
00:02:47 like the laziness and the non-conformity
00:02:51 and you know the unwillingness to do
00:02:53 trudgery
00:02:54 is that a word i think so yeah the
00:02:56 unwillingness to do
00:02:58 the you know like boring mundane life
00:03:01 choices jobs that's what leads people to
00:03:03 comedy yeah maybe i could just talk shit
00:03:05 yeah yeah i literally thought i always
00:03:08 knew i wanted to like entertain people
00:03:10 somehow
00:03:11 i didn't know exactly how until my
00:03:13 senior year of high school but
00:03:14 before that i was like maybe i'll be a
00:03:16 singer or a comedian you know
00:03:18 well you have a great voice i have a
00:03:19 decent voice you have a very good voice
00:03:21 thank you um
00:03:21 and you use it in your act sometimes i
00:03:23 try you do um
00:03:25 you started doing stand-up how old were
00:03:27 you

00:07:57 shafir
00:07:57 and just like let's see what's up yeah
00:07:59 and then i had been doing that for
00:08:01 for a couple months i'd say just like
00:08:04 doing the hosting spot or like
00:08:06 little opening spots at the improv in
00:08:08 the comedy store
00:08:09 and then you were like oh i was like oh
00:08:11 i saw that you're going to be in vegas
00:08:13 this week
00:08:13 like i think i'm going to drive and come
00:08:15 watch you because i've never seen you in
00:08:17 like a bigger
00:08:17 venue than a comedy club and you you
00:08:20 were like okay
00:08:22 do you want to open and i was like well
00:08:24 i wasn't hoping you'd say that but i was
00:08:25 kind of hoping you'd say that
00:08:27 so you did vegas that was the coolest
00:08:30 experience of my entire life still to
00:08:32 this day one of like the highlights
00:08:34 of my life it was really fun it was
00:08:36 really fun but you were so composed
00:08:38 and so like on top of it you crushed
00:08:42 and then i said okay do you want to do
00:08:44 an arena
00:08:47 you went from i mean how many times have
00:08:49 you been paid to do stand up other than
00:08:51 the times opening for me
00:08:52 and you know like a couple little gigs
00:08:54 in the road yeah i mean i never really
00:08:56 got paid to do comedy like besides like
00:08:59 drinks or like a couple bucks for gas
00:09:02 so you do the mirage which is like i
00:09:05 think the mirage is
00:09:06 1300 people or 1200 people it's a
00:09:08 good-sized place yeah
00:09:09 good sized place then we do a fucking
00:09:12 gigantic
00:09:13 basketball arena you know what i think
00:09:15 you know what i think helped me with the
00:09:16 mirage
00:09:17 was in my head i was like 1200 is giant
00:09:20 i was like this is gonna be huge crazy
00:09:23 and i like
00:09:24 over hyped it so much that by the time i
00:09:27 saw the venue it was like
00:09:29 it was so beautiful and it felt intimate
00:09:31 for some reason
00:09:32 well it's the most intimate place in
00:09:34 vegas in terms of like those big
00:09:36 theaters you can play
00:09:37 yeah it's my favorite place in vegas i
00:09:38 love it yeah so as soon as i got there i
00:09:40 was like
00:09:41 i got this i used i was doing bigger
00:09:43 places there and i came
00:09:44 back to the mirage just because it's a
00:09:46 better setup yeah and i feel like the
00:09:47 people who
00:09:48 run that place were really helpful
00:09:49 they're awesome they're the best they're
00:09:51 the nicest folks and they all
00:09:52 love comedy yeah you know there you are
00:09:54 that's you kid oh
00:09:55 jamie was taking pictures i was like can
00:09:57 you get more my mom really wants to see
00:09:59 me
00:09:59 yeah it's too bad you can't really see
00:10:01 the audience in there too but
00:10:02 um so then you go from that what
00:10:06 what arena did we do we went to i
00:10:09 believe
00:10:10 denver was it portland oh
00:10:13 yeah it was the moda center yeah that
00:10:15 place is fucking huge
00:10:16 yeah oh my god and it was in the round
00:10:18 the first one was in the round so
00:10:20 there's literally people
00:10:21 all around me i'm like i don't know
00:10:23 where to stand i don't know like how to
00:10:25 use the space of the stage
00:10:27 yeah that's like 13 or 14 000. oh my
00:10:29 gosh
00:10:30 bananas but i told you after i was like
00:10:33 you know what i hate about this
00:10:34 is that this feels the best way to
00:10:36 perform
00:10:37 i was like this is where i feel the most
00:10:40 myself
00:10:41 well it's definitely the biggest pop
00:10:44 like the rush that you get from a big a
00:10:47 big choke that kills
00:10:49 in you know a 15 000 seat arena or
00:10:51 whatever it's
00:10:52 it's bananas like the biggest i did was
00:10:54 chappelle and i did
00:10:55 uh the tacoma dome yeah we did 25 000
00:10:58 that looked crazy it was bonkers like
00:11:01 when you would hear the laughs they were
00:11:03 deafening it was that people scream 25
00:11:05 000 people screaming it's just was there
00:11:07 like an echo like a wave
00:11:09 it's what it's nuts it's wild because i
00:11:12 remember after the moda center which is
00:11:13 like an
00:11:14 inside arena then we did um that outdoor
00:11:17 theater amphitheater in
00:11:18 the bay area um yeah yeah we're the
00:11:21 grateful dead
00:11:22 yeah yeah yeah that was fun too that was
00:11:24 fun but that was cool because it was
00:11:26 outdoors and i was like there's a lawn
00:11:28 like i it was just crazy because when i
00:11:30 was little i would always go to concerts
00:11:32 and
00:11:33 i would always watch the performer and
00:11:34 i'd be like i want to do that so the
00:11:36 first time i got to like do the arena
00:11:38 and the amphitheater i was like
00:11:40 i'm literally doing what i've always
00:11:42 wanted to do
00:11:43 yeah those shows are fucking awesome but
00:11:46 i still think
00:11:48 200 people is the that's the right size
00:11:51 two to three hundred people is the right
00:11:52 size yeah i agree
00:11:54 like if you wanted it's like there's no
00:11:56 nothing wrong with those shows they're
00:11:58 awesome
00:11:58 i love doing arenas but the
00:12:02 you know like the original rooms like
00:12:03 190 people that
00:12:05 shit is perfect yeah when everything's
00:12:07 popping
00:12:08 i i like the 200 300 range or even
00:12:12 smaller because that's when you get like
00:12:13 the honest feedback yeah and i think
00:12:15 that's why it's fun to also do the like
00:12:17 arena or amphitheater because
00:12:19 it's the jokes that you've been working
00:12:21 on that you know work right
00:12:22 and so you're getting the response that
00:12:24 you want from those jokes and you kind
00:12:25 of almost
00:12:26 expect that response but when you're
00:12:28 doing the smaller intimate shows
00:12:30 that's when you get the like kind of
00:12:31 pause where you're like huh maybe that
00:12:33 joke needs tweaking or like you can
00:12:35 figure out
00:12:36 yeah and that way when you do get a pop
00:12:38 in like a smaller room you're like oh
00:12:40 that really works
00:12:41 yeah small small crowds like late at
00:12:43 night that's when you find out if you're
00:12:45 full of shit
00:12:46 yeah because you get to see the the fat
00:12:48 in your act you get to see the clunky
00:12:50 fucking those weird segues that you do
00:12:53 or yeah or when you act something out it
00:12:55 seems
00:12:55 cheap and stupid you're like oh my god
00:12:57 like you're just doing it in front of
00:12:58 like three people you're like oh
00:13:00 yeah material's terrible yeah that's why
00:13:02 i liked working at the comedy store
00:13:03 because you'd have to be there until the
00:13:06 last person's off stage
00:13:07 how much comedy have you done during the
00:13:09 quarantine
00:13:10 um i've done a decent amount of zoom
00:13:13 shows
00:13:14 and then we're on those they're weird i
00:13:17 kind of just like
00:13:18 i think i grew up always being like on
00:13:20 the internet and interacting with
00:13:22 strangers online
00:13:23 so i i felt like i was prepared
00:13:26 for something like a zoom show and i
00:13:28 also was like okay don't look

00:13:38 you can and like see where it goes have
00:13:40 no expectations
00:13:42 it's just something to do yeah yeah it
00:13:44 fucking blows
00:13:45 mark norman said it best he said like
00:13:47 it's like methadone comedy
00:13:48 yeah he's like you know he was talking
00:13:50 about how he did uh

00:13:55 park normand so good but it's
00:13:58 you know we're all like desperate to get

00:14:02 we're not doing any comedy but new york
00:14:04 is doing stand-up again
00:14:05 yeah i've seen that yeah which is crazy
00:14:08 i feel like i'm starting to see
00:14:09 some shows my friends are doing some
00:14:11 shows outdoors here
00:14:13 so i don't know i'm kind of hopeful but
00:14:15 i'm also like
00:14:16 if if i get an offer to go to a state
00:14:19 that's open and doing comedy
00:14:21 i would take it are you taking vitamins
00:14:24 are you
00:14:25 taking care of yourself you just tested
00:14:27 negative i just trusted negative you
00:14:28 don't have the vid
00:14:29 i don't i don't cut the kobe but i've
00:14:31 been getting tested a lot because my
00:14:33 sister just moved to arizona
00:14:35 last year so i've been going out there a
00:14:37 lot which is
00:14:39 hot for the rona yeah yeah
00:14:42 and so i've been getting tested really
00:14:44 frequently and
00:14:45 whenever they say like it's hot for the
00:14:47 roanoke i always wonder like what makes
00:14:48 some place hotter than others like why
00:14:50 why are other places more susceptible
00:14:52 like what's going on there
00:14:54 i don't know well i guess with arizona
00:14:55 everything's open
00:14:58 corona never happened there yeah they
00:14:59 don't give a fuck yeah well that's a
00:15:01 wild west town i know i told them i'm
00:15:02 like they're the coveted cowboys yeah
00:15:04 they're wearing maskless chaps
00:15:06 they they have open carry like you could
00:15:08 have a gun
00:15:09 i know i just walk into a store i did a
00:15:11 show in arizona i was like what are you
00:15:12 guys gonna do shoot
00:15:13 coven when you see it is that your
00:15:15 defense well
00:15:17 in their defense like they're on the
00:15:18 border of mexico and that is a place
00:15:20 that has literally changed very little
00:15:22 since people came across the fucking
00:15:24 country and covered wagons
00:15:25 yeah like that's arizona yeah like
00:15:27 arizona like
00:15:29 phoenix is as big as i love arizona

00:15:46 first place i headlined
00:15:48 and the casey the manager there one of
00:15:52 the best
00:15:52 people ever he just like i feel like
00:15:54 every comedy club manager
00:15:56 should like take a class under casey
00:15:58 because he's like so compassionate and
00:16:01 he gets it
00:16:02 and he's like not full of bullshit he's
00:16:04 just like an honest caring dude i feel
00:16:06 like he rubs that
00:16:07 he runs that club so well well that
00:16:09 place has a history of cool people
00:16:11 running it because adam egate used to be
00:16:12 there yeah and paige from the improv
00:16:14 yep that's where i met both of them i
00:16:16 think i met paige there i might have met
00:16:17 yeah i think i met paige there
00:16:19 um i just feel bad for those people not
00:16:21 oh you're taking the
00:16:23 no i was like what's that sound how
00:16:25 about how addicted to those things
00:16:26 so addicted completely addicted yeah
00:16:29 well
00:16:29 when i was at my mom's house during
00:16:32 lockdown my mom's a smoker
00:16:33 a boy i know it's just it's this weird
00:16:36 thing when they get to be a certain age
00:16:37 and they're still smoking all the time
00:16:39 right now you are on the edge huh well
00:16:41 she was trying to read that book
00:16:43 alan carr's book stop smoking how about
00:16:46 just stop smoking
00:16:47 well i guess if you've been doing it all
00:16:48 your life i don't know
00:16:50 take up another hobby i know you'll have
00:16:52 to talk to her we'll get her on the pot
00:16:54 no one's gonna she's not yeah no when
00:16:56 you're when you're in it you're in it
00:16:58 you know but when i was with her
00:17:00 she was smoking and i'm like i don't
00:17:01 want to be smoking like
00:17:03 because my mom always says don't smoke
00:17:04 it's bad and i've just been smoking
00:17:06 since i was like 17.
00:17:08 but i quit for two months off nick off
00:17:11 like the
00:17:12 jewel cigarettes um at the beginning of
00:17:15 lockdown
00:17:15 for two months so why'd you start back
00:17:17 up again because then i came back home
00:17:18 to la and i was like
00:17:20 what was the first one like did you know
00:17:21 that you're being a loser no you're
00:17:23 reaching for that first one well that's
00:17:24 like no because in my head i'm like
00:17:28 it's just one hit of the jewel i'm fine
00:17:32 i'm not gonna get addicted again i got
00:17:35 this
00:17:36 and then a couple more times i hit my
00:17:38 friend's jewel and i was like i need to
00:17:39 buy my own
00:17:40 damn yeah that's what happened with
00:17:42 cigarettes like i wasn't addicted
00:17:44 like i think people think that if you
00:17:47 smoke one cigarette you're gonna be
00:17:48 addicted and that's not the case
00:17:50 i smoked one and i was fine no i've
00:17:52 smoked one multiple times
00:17:54 before shows yeah i i started with tony
00:17:57 i smoked one of tony's before a show
00:17:59 back when tony used to smoke and i was
00:18:01 like dude this gives you a crazy
00:18:02 rush you smoked mine in uh like saint
00:18:05 louis or saint paul or something and you
00:18:06 were like
00:18:07 buzzing i took some cigarettes from dave
00:18:09 chappelle and we did shows together
00:18:10 um a cigarette before a show gets you
00:18:13 buzzed
00:18:14 cigar doesn't quite get you that buzzed
00:18:16 like you gotta inhale and i think
00:18:18 there's like whatever funky chemicals
00:18:19 they put in those cigarettes to get you
00:18:20 addicted
00:18:21 those are good yeah those those they're
00:18:23 so yummy those chemists are fucking
00:18:25 they know what they're doing they do
00:18:27 it's so unfortunate they kill people
00:18:29 yeah it's crazy that no one's trying to
00:18:31 stop it but yet it kills half a million
00:18:33 people a year
00:18:34 that's what's bizarre that everybody's
00:18:36 worried about kovid kovet has killed
00:18:38 less than 200 000 people cigarettes have
00:18:40 killed probably
00:18:42 in the same time of cobit more than 200
00:18:44 000 people it's always crazy when you
00:18:46 find out someone
00:18:47 like someone's family member or friend
00:18:50 got lung cancer and never smoked
00:18:52 that always freaks me out yeah you can
00:18:54 get lung cancer
00:18:55 yeah you can get lung cancer from toxins
00:18:57 in the air you can get lung cancer from
00:18:59 genetics you can get lung cancer you
00:19:00 know environmental shit if you work in a
00:19:02 factory that has a lot of weird fumes
00:19:04 but there's also so many things that
00:19:06 kill people like fast food is so
00:19:08 unhealthy i love that too
00:19:11 what's your go-to taco bell really you
00:19:14 like eating garbage i love
00:19:16 garlic it's like straight i that's why
00:19:17 you're shitting your pants all the time
00:19:19 it was once okay only once yeah i've
00:19:22 shipped my pants at least
00:19:24 once this month you've got a couple more
00:19:25 years on me yeah yeah but i mean i also
00:19:28 eat
00:19:29 like a lot of meat yeah doesn't that
00:19:30 make you shit oh yeah yeah yeah
00:19:32 does meat give you loose oh my god it
00:19:34 gives you the most
00:19:36 ridiculous diarrhea like i told tom
00:19:38 segura you got to try this carnivore
00:19:40 diet because he was trying to lose
00:19:41 weight and i lost
00:19:42 12 pounds in a month i got shredded but
00:19:45 isn't that
00:19:45 kind of unhealthy to lose that much
00:19:47 weight in a month i don't know it felt
00:19:49 great
00:19:49 okay i don't know yeah i really don't
00:19:51 know i was going to get my blood work
00:19:53 done but then i had a travel and then
00:19:55 the covid hit and i was like oh
00:19:56 christ yeah um i forget what my excuse
00:19:59 was i had an excuse
00:20:00 yeah not a good one but i had an excuse
00:20:02 do you want to get fast food oh yeah
00:20:04 when you called me yesterday you were in
00:20:05 and out
00:20:06 yeah yeah you had the craziest order
00:20:07 well i thought you were feeding your
00:20:09 whole family with your order
00:20:11 he was on speaker he was like yeah can i
00:20:12 get like 12 flying dutchmen
00:20:14 no four i just have four flying dutchmen
00:20:17 it's not that much meat
00:20:18 i guess is that one patty or two two
00:20:20 patties with cheese
00:20:22 so that's a total of eight patties yes
00:20:25 okay gotta feed all this yeah meat you
00:20:27 know do you eat like three meals a day
00:20:30 no one generally i eat um very light in
00:20:33 the morning
00:20:34 usually unless i have a really hard
00:20:36 workout and then
00:20:37 like this morning i just had eggs um
00:20:40 just a couple like three eggs
00:20:42 yeah and um how do you cook them fry
00:20:46 fried eggs i thought that i would know
00:20:49 how to cook eggs at this point in my
00:20:51 life you know i'm 24. that's something
00:20:53 that's pretty basic you don't know how
00:20:54 to do it i keep fucking up
00:20:55 eggs how do you fuck that up i i get
00:20:57 really impatient and so i put the heat
00:20:59 on the pan way too high
00:21:01 and then the eggs are just like fried
00:21:03 instantly but i've gotten better i'm
00:21:04 getting better but i don't think i could
00:21:06 fry eggs this is not that complicated
00:21:08 you know you have a very minor issue
00:21:10 that you're complaining about here
00:21:13 so i'd eat that you know i'll eat like a
00:21:15 light breakfast before workout and then
00:21:16 i work out and then i won't eat until
00:21:18 dinner
00:21:19 i usually eat twice a day okay then i
00:21:20 eat a large yeah
00:21:22 i see it on your instagram well you've
00:21:24 seen me eat
00:21:25 live like yeah in real time it's an
00:21:28 experience
00:21:29 it's like going to the zoo and like
00:21:31 feeding a giraffe you're like whoa
00:21:33 well people don't believe it like when i
00:21:35 go to uh a restaurant and i'll order two
00:21:37 entrees like
00:21:38 like the waiters are like what are you
00:21:40 doing yeah like you're not gonna eat all
00:21:42 that i'm like just watch me bitch it's
00:21:43 fun going out to eat with you because
00:21:45 when i was growing up my dad would you
00:21:46 know
00:21:47 we i have two older sisters and my dad
00:21:49 was kind of single dad shop
00:21:50 like food on a budget and so he'd be
00:21:52 like you know the drill
00:21:53 no soda water only like
00:21:56 the bare minimum so then when we get to
00:21:59 go out after shows and eat i'm like
00:22:01 i can get two entrees if i want and an
00:22:03 appetizer
00:22:05 yeah that is uh the good thing about
00:22:08 growing up poor
00:22:09 is that you really appreciate when you
00:22:11 know you get good stuff
00:22:12 yeah i don't want to say i grew up poor
00:22:14 but we weren't like
00:22:16 you know right you weren't starving yeah
00:22:17 yeah well i grew up
00:22:20 you know i mean we weren't starving
00:22:21 either but we were poor yeah you know we
00:22:23 were on welfare when i was a kid we
00:22:25 drank powdered milk you know the whole
00:22:26 deal we had we're on food stamps
00:22:28 yeah and um i'm on food stamps now are
00:22:30 you
00:22:31 yeah that's so crazy i know i'm on
00:22:33 unemployment
00:22:35 it's crazy how much are they giving you
00:22:37 how much they give you for unemployment
00:22:38 i think
00:22:39 i you have to like put in all of your
00:22:41 information and like you know whatever
00:22:43 and so
00:22:43 i think i'm getting like 400 a week
00:22:47 um the good news is you're you're living
00:22:49 with your mom right so
00:22:50 no i'm living in my house oh you are
00:22:52 yeah yeah well you were with your mom
00:22:53 for a little while
00:22:54 yeah but i kept my place because i was
00:22:55 like who knows how long this is going to
00:22:57 last who knows if i want to stay at my
00:22:59 mom's house whatever
00:23:00 like it's nice to know i have that as an
00:23:02 option because my parents live like
00:23:04 in the greater los angeles area i read
00:23:06 that they're going to uh
00:23:08 there was a ban on evictions and and
00:23:12 and you know and making people forcing
00:23:14 people to pay rent yeah
00:23:15 but that's going to go up september 1st
00:23:17 they're going to force people to start
00:23:18 paying again
00:23:19 but i'm like i've just been paying my
00:23:21 rent but what happens to those people
00:23:23 if you have five months of back rent
00:23:26 and the rent is three thousand dollars a
00:23:28 month or something that's crazy
00:23:30 yeah and all of a sudden you have to pay
00:23:31 it all yeah it makes no sense
00:23:34 that's why i was like i'm gonna pay mine
00:23:35 now because
00:23:37 who knows how much money i'm gonna have
00:23:39 saved up after this
00:23:40 so i might as well just pay luckily my
00:23:42 rent is like cheap so it's manageable
00:23:45 um and if i ever was in a pinch like i
00:23:47 know my parents would help me out how
00:23:49 long did you think this was gonna last
00:23:52 uh i've everyone was saying it was gonna
00:23:54 last like three months
00:23:56 but i was like this is gonna last longer
00:23:58 there's no way
00:24:00 things are just gonna be like okay if we
00:24:01 do this it's all gonna go back to normal
00:24:04 it just felt too big for it to be over
00:24:06 that quickly
00:24:07 well i was optimistic unfortunately i i
00:24:10 really did think it was
00:24:11 me three months i thought it was gonna
00:24:12 be two months really yeah i was like
00:24:14 look it takes you get sick and then
00:24:16 you're only sick
00:24:17 for like a week right so if everybody
00:24:20 just stays home
00:24:22 the people that are sick will get better
00:24:23 people won't get infected this is simple
00:24:26 i just feel like i'm like americans or
00:24:28 so
00:24:29 like uh don't tell me what to do yes
00:24:32 and there's america's such a big country
00:24:35 how would you expect everyone to be on
00:24:38 the same page
00:24:39 well we're it's a big country we're all
00:24:41 crazy yeah and we travel around a lot
00:24:43 yeah yeah and spit in each other's face
00:24:45 yeah and here you go
00:24:46 here we are five months later is it five
00:24:49 now
00:24:50 yeah right yeah it's five months five
00:24:52 fucking months no no end in sight do you
00:24:54 feel like it's gone by fast or slow for
00:24:56 you slow
00:24:57 it doesn't feel good i don't like it i'm
00:24:59 not worried about myself i'm worried
00:25:00 about other people and i'm worried about
00:25:01 the city i'm worried about the economic
00:25:03 aspects of this as much as i'm worried
00:25:05 about the health aspects of it yeah
00:25:07 cause it just i don't know how
00:25:08 look when people get sick they get
00:25:10 better right hopefully
00:25:12 but when a city gets that far gone like
00:25:15 as far as la is right now like i don't
00:25:16 know how a city bounces back i've never
00:25:18 seen it happen
00:25:19 like i've seen cities that used to be
00:25:21 big like have you ever been to detroit
00:25:23 do we ever do a gig in detroit
00:25:24 detroit is interesting okay because
00:25:26 detroit used to be one of the most
00:25:28 wealthy cities in the world like at one
00:25:31 point in time during the height of the
00:25:32 auto industry
00:25:33 you'd go to detroit and it was fucking
00:25:35 cadillacs and
00:25:37 camaros and corvettes and it was
00:25:39 beautiful and everybody was making money
00:25:40 and it was just
00:25:41 amazing now detroit is sketchy as fuck
00:25:44 isn't it getting coming back a little
00:25:46 bit yeah a little bit but when you drive
00:25:48 through detroit you could buy a house
00:25:49 for like five bucks
00:25:50 crazy the uh the guys from top gear they
00:25:53 have a new show now it's called the
00:25:54 grand
00:25:55 tour is that what it's called grand tour
00:25:58 um they bought homes in detroit they
00:26:01 went to detroit and just bought houses
00:26:02 they were like bought a house for like
00:26:03 two thousand dollars and then they were
00:26:05 like you know like showing like what you
00:26:07 can buy for two thousand bucks and then
00:26:08 they were driving their cars
00:26:09 crazy so crazy i think once i make like
00:26:12 a good amount of money the first thing
00:26:14 i'm going to do is
00:26:15 invest detroit yeah move to detroit
00:26:18 no i think i would like invest in real
00:26:20 estate that's what everyone says
00:26:22 right don't listen to everyone okay yeah
00:26:24 i mean
00:26:25 investing in real estate is generally a
00:26:26 good idea if you do it in the right
00:26:28 place
00:26:29 but you know i don't know just keep
00:26:31 kicking ass i remember when covid first
00:26:33 started i hit you up i was like joe i'm
00:26:35 scared do you have a guest
00:26:36 house and you're like i'm scared too i'm
00:26:38 like that's not the answer i was looking
00:26:40 for
00:26:40 i was scared if you're scared i'm scared
00:26:43 in the beginning i was real scared yeah
00:26:44 yeah because i was like because i didn't
00:26:46 know
00:26:47 first of all the information you get
00:26:49 from china is so
00:26:51 it's so filtered by the communist party
00:26:54 or the
00:26:54 the the chinese government so like who
00:26:57 is
00:26:58 telling the truth like how bad is this
00:27:00 so when they hit
00:27:01 and then you know when you see them
00:27:03 driving on the street with those big
00:27:05 tanks spraying the houses do you ever
00:27:07 see those videos from china
00:27:08 no i don't oh yeah yeah yeah like light
00:27:10 big lights all trunks
00:27:11 like ghostbusters exactly i was like
00:27:13 this is not good
00:27:14 no what are they doing and then you were
00:27:16 getting information from
00:27:18 cruise ships that were saying that it
00:27:19 lasts up to 17 days
00:27:21 just on surfaces i'm like oh my god
00:27:23 we're fucked super bug
00:27:25 i was on a cruise at the beginning of
00:27:26 the year so i got it i got it out of the
00:27:28 way
00:27:29 you were on a cruise yeah i i got booked
00:27:31 to perform on a rave cruise
00:27:33 oh jesus and i was like this might be
00:27:35 the worst experience of my life
00:27:37 but there's no way i can pass up on
00:27:39 having that you know
00:27:40 was it good it was so fun it honestly
00:27:43 like changed my life
00:27:45 i like i was like first of all who goes
00:27:48 on a rave cruise
00:27:49 second of all who goes to see comedy on
00:27:51 a rave cruise
00:27:52 yeah and so i was like i need to bring a
00:27:54 friend so i brought my friend danny and
00:27:56 i was like he's gonna be the perfect
00:27:57 person to have whether this is the best
00:27:59 or the worst time
00:28:00 and we pull up to the port in miami and
00:28:03 it's like 11 a.m and there's people in
00:28:04 like blue wigs and fishnets drinking
00:28:07 like jack daniels
00:28:08 oh that's me i look at that smile
00:28:11 you look so happy i was and look at
00:28:13 everybody has no mask on
00:28:14 no mass this was uh what a good time the
00:28:17 old days
00:28:18 the old look at it looks like i have abs
00:28:19 in that picture when do you think we're
00:28:21 gonna go back this is january 21st this
00:28:23 is right before the world ended
00:28:24 yeah when do you think we're gonna go
00:28:25 back to no masks
00:28:28 do you think some people are just going
00:28:29 to wear masks forever now i think so
00:28:30 yeah
00:28:31 yeah well it isn't like uh i watched
00:28:33 this japanese reality show
00:28:35 and uh it's so good it's called terrace
00:28:38 house
00:28:38 and they just film people in this house
00:28:40 it's beautiful and um
00:28:42 and people over there wear masks when
00:28:44 they're sick like that's just always
00:28:45 been a thing and so i think maybe that's
00:28:47 something that'll be implemented
00:28:49 well they did a really good job in
00:28:51 stopping covid because of that yeah just
00:28:53 because they wear masks all the time
00:28:55 they didn't stop
00:28:55 their businesses yeah they didn't close
00:28:57 down and they only
00:28:59 i think only a thousand people died yeah
00:29:02 see if that's true i think that's the
00:29:04 number and they're starting to have
00:29:05 resurgence in cases unfortunately
00:29:07 but it's probably and now everyone's
00:29:09 like losing their hair
00:29:10 what they are yeah i heard this
00:29:14 and other people i think with her it
00:29:16 might be do
00:29:17 she might be having a lot of stress in
00:29:18 her life she seems like a little high
00:29:20 school stressed out that lady needs a
00:29:22 joint
00:29:22 what is that i don't know
00:29:26 recovered 35 000 1 000 deaths that's
00:29:29 amazing 1073 deaths in japan
00:29:31 that's amazing that's incredible yeah
00:29:33 that's incredible i mean how do they do
00:29:34 that i don't know
00:29:35 and look at their big spike the big
00:29:37 spike is like towards the end of uh
00:29:39 it looks like april 22nd do you think
00:29:41 that this is like
00:29:42 mostly accurate as best i think japan is
00:29:45 honest yeah i mean but just they're just
00:29:47 very disciplined you know they're very
00:29:48 disciplined and
00:29:49 they follow order yeah like if you have
00:29:52 you ever gone
00:29:53 no i want it it's beautiful i wanted to
00:29:56 it's really interesting
00:29:57 it's like you're i love the i love when
00:29:59 people are just human beings
00:30:01 but they have a whole different way of
00:30:03 doing things like you go there like oh
00:30:04 look how they do it
00:30:05 yeah you walk down the street
00:30:06 everybody's like real polite like
00:30:08 nobody's bumping into each other
00:30:10 yelling at each other it's like very
00:30:11 orderly yeah and
00:30:13 you know it's it's interesting it's like
00:30:14 really packed with people
00:30:16 but there's no litter yeah it's what's
00:30:18 your favorite country you've been to
00:30:21 well
00:30:23 i'm a big fan of america um i love
00:30:25 canada
00:30:27 i mean i guess that's kind of a country
00:30:28 that's separate from us because
00:30:30 you could walk over there but i mean you
00:30:31 could walk to mexico too yeah i love
00:30:34 canada to perform
00:30:35 they're fuck they're so nice up there
00:30:36 they're like america but i always say
00:30:38 with 20
00:30:39 less douchebags that's nice they're
00:30:41 fucking nice
00:30:42 they're really nice and it's cold and
00:30:44 they so it violates my
00:30:45 uh dickhead cold weather theory i used
00:30:47 to have a dickhead cold weather theory
00:30:49 because i grew up in boston
00:30:50 i was like why is everybody's dickheads
00:30:51 here because it's fucking freezing
00:30:53 but it's not because canada is colder
00:30:54 than that and they're nice if you go
00:30:56 from boston to montreal it'll ruin your
00:30:58 dickhead cold weather theory
00:31:00 yeah cause i'm like well it's fucking
00:31:01 colder here and people are nice
00:31:03 maybe it gets so cold that they're
00:31:05 forced to be nice uh
00:31:07 yeah because they're all struggling to
00:31:08 stay together yeah have you been
00:31:10 montreal no i've never been to canada
00:31:12 oh you gotta go it's awesome i was
00:31:13 hoping to do new faces this year
00:31:16 but if i had a bail off the continental
00:31:18 north america
00:31:19 if i had to get out of this this spot i
00:31:21 would go to australia
00:31:23 oh i love australia really yeah i've
00:31:25 never been but it's not a place that
00:31:26 like
00:31:27 i'm super dying to go to i i really want
00:31:30 to go to new zealand i would go there
00:31:32 too i've never been but it looks amazing
00:31:33 road trip
00:31:34 oh my gosh they just had four new cases
00:31:38 yeah yeah they're pretty impressive but
00:31:41 um australia the first thing i would do
00:31:43 if i
00:31:43 did move there is uh trying to convince
00:31:45 them to drive on the right side of the
00:31:46 road
00:31:47 like what are you doing it's weird why
00:31:49 are you over here with you standing
00:31:50 on the wrong side how did that happen
00:31:52 what happened when we came over to
00:31:54 america was someone just like let's just
00:31:56 switch it all
00:31:56 up everybody's jealous of us because
00:31:58 we're the shit instead of like they do
00:32:00 it like that we're going to do it like
00:32:01 this yeah
00:32:02 do you know why though honestly no
00:32:04 that's all i'm asking um the reason why
00:32:06 is they drive on the left side of the
00:32:08 road because if you were a knight
00:32:11 and you were like in combat you would
00:32:13 want to have your enemy on your right
00:32:15 side
00:32:16 so if you were riding towards them you
00:32:18 would want to have your enemy so you
00:32:20 could slash at them with your
00:32:22 your dominant arm
00:32:25 yeah that's also why when you shake
00:32:27 someone's hand you shake someone's hand
00:32:28 with your right hand because that's your
00:32:29 dominant arm
00:32:30 yeah supposedly yeah so that's your
00:32:32 sword arm
00:32:33 so these are all sword people they're
00:32:34 all old fucking what type of cards were
00:32:36 knights driving
00:32:38 like a cadillac escalator on horses
00:32:39 honey oh okay
00:32:44 and stab each other they would want to
00:32:46 do their right arm so they want the
00:32:47 enemy to be
00:32:48 on the right side of them crazy yeah so
00:32:50 they were on the left side of the road
00:32:52 hmm it's weird to think that that's i
00:32:53 might have made that up maybe
00:32:55 you know i just trust i have blind faith
00:32:57 i'm like i know less so i'll just
00:32:59 take that as a fact yeah i still talk
00:33:01 like the days before the internet i just
00:33:02 start saying shit and i'm not sure if i
00:33:04 fully researched it i know
00:33:05 but that's the crazy thing about the
00:33:07 internet is i feel so confused
00:33:09 all the time you can with many things
00:33:12 with many subjects you can get really
00:33:13 confused is that a fact i mean
00:33:15 i've i'm pretty sure that's right but i
00:33:16 know like america drives on the right
00:33:18 because we're like fuck that we're
00:33:19 driving
00:33:19 or like we invented cars bro
00:33:22 fuck that we're driving on the right
00:33:24 forward motherfucker but i get to anti
00:33:25 drive on the left is why we drive on the
00:33:27 right
00:33:28 it's because they drive on the left is
00:33:29 why we're driving the right kind
00:33:31 um yeah we're like the younger sibling
00:33:34 who's like fuck you we do it our own way
00:33:36 oh you that's how you drive with horses
00:33:37 well with cars we're gonna just flip it
00:33:39 yeah i don't know i mean
00:33:40 what is the reason why they decided to
00:33:42 drive on the right it's got to be a
00:33:43 reason
00:33:43 that's that's what i'm saying it it's
00:33:45 it's colonization just to be different
00:33:47 fuck british in the early colonization
00:33:49 of north america english driving customs
00:33:51 were followed and the colonies drove on
00:33:52 the left
00:33:53 ah after gaining independence from that
00:33:55 makes sense
00:33:56 they were anxious to cast off all
00:33:58 remaining links with their british
00:34:00 colonial past
00:34:01 and gradually change to right-hand
00:34:03 driving aha
00:34:05 that makes sense have you ever did you
00:34:08 when you were in australia did you like
00:34:09 rent a car and drive yourself on
00:34:11 the left side no i have never driven a
00:34:13 car on the left-hand side yeah
00:34:14 i remember reading about matthew
00:34:16 broderick and he was over in ireland i
00:34:18 believe and he got in a fatal
00:34:20 car crash smashed into someone and the
00:34:22 speculation was that he was on the wrong
00:34:24 side of the road like he was coming home
00:34:25 from the set and then he fucked up i
00:34:27 remember reading that i don't know if
00:34:28 that's the case but i do know he was in
00:34:30 a
00:34:30 a bad car crash and i was like oh my god
00:34:32 you got to be on your fucking
00:34:34 p's and q's if you're driving on the
00:34:35 left side of the road because your head
00:34:37 like
00:34:37 do you know when you're driving you get
00:34:38 in that weird auto
00:34:40 mode where you just like you ever be in
00:34:42 your car and then
00:34:43 i don't know how i get home sometimes
00:34:45 like how did i get here do you text and
00:34:47 drive
00:34:47 no okay no i do not i do not yeah i mean
00:34:51 i have a little slot in my car from my
00:34:53 phone it just goes
00:34:54 right in there and i don't i don't do
00:34:56 shit in every car you have you have a
00:34:57 slot
00:34:57 well the car that i drive the most yeah
00:34:59 the tess

00:35:02 to do is this i like to do hey siri

00:35:49 like how i whenever i meet a young
00:35:50 person i'm like are you on tick tock i
00:35:52 know the dances
00:35:53 the chinese government is watching you
00:35:55 do you think they're actually going to
00:35:56 ban it
00:35:57 yes i think they're going to force a
00:35:58 sale that's what i think i think
00:36:00 probably some big american tech company
00:36:02 is going to buy it because um there was
00:36:04 a
00:36:05 group of software i don't know if a
00:36:06 group or some software engineer
00:36:08 that uh back engineered tick tock and
00:36:10 they said this is the worst
00:36:12 application we've ever seen in terms of
00:36:14 violation of privacy
00:36:15 wow it's the worst like it tracks
00:36:17 fucking everything
00:36:19 and they send that information directly
00:36:21 to the chinese government so they're
00:36:22 data mining
00:36:23 is it bad that i don't give a fuck don't
00:36:26 give a fuck
00:36:27 should i care more that people are
00:36:29 taking my privacy
00:36:30 um this is how i feel about that okay
00:36:33 you are
00:36:34 a 24 year old stand-up comedian 25 next
00:36:37 month
00:36:37 so you're like what am i gonna do what
00:36:40 are you gonna do what are you gonna find
00:36:40 out where i should yeah
00:36:42 are you gonna find out where i take naps
00:36:43 i keep my laptop on with the camera on
00:36:45 when i'm pooping just in case
00:36:47 if the government's watching i want them
00:36:48 to get the full range of me you know
00:36:50 i feel like if they're why they're
00:36:52 paying attention to like hedge fund guys
00:36:54 who are trying to overthrow governments
00:36:55 yeah you know they're they're paying
00:36:56 attention to like they don't care about
00:36:58 me
00:36:59 what do we do we're fucking we talk shit
00:37:02 yeah
00:37:02 what you know people who think that the
00:37:03 government's watching everything you do
00:37:05 like but bro you're boring
00:37:06 yeah okay they're not they're not paying
00:37:08 attention to you i guarantee you they're
00:37:09 not
00:37:10 but they're probably watching you don't
00:37:12 you think yeah they're watching
00:37:14 they listen to everything i say i'm sure
00:37:16 but i mean say everything publicly so
00:37:17 yeah the things that get me in the most
00:37:19 trouble i say right here yeah
00:37:21 just talking shit but you know that's
00:37:24 the business the business is the talking
00:37:25 shit business
00:37:26 yeah what are you gonna do but that's
00:37:28 the thing
00:37:29 to get back to like being so confused
00:37:31 about information now because there's so
00:37:33 much information i don't know what to
00:37:35 believe
00:37:36 isn't it crazy like having a podcast and
00:37:38 then like saying something and being
00:37:40 like i don't know if that's right well
00:37:41 that's what jamie's for
00:37:42 jamie jamie jamie pulls things up all
00:37:46 the time that i thought were right
00:37:47 i know i've always actually actually
00:37:50 you're wrong
00:37:51 well i mean if you're coming to me as
00:37:54 your major source of information you are
00:37:56 already fucked
00:37:57 yeah if i say something that i
00:37:59 absolutely know to be sure i will say
00:38:01 that i absolutely know this to be sure
00:38:03 yeah if i say something and i go i don't
00:38:05 know if that's true
00:38:06 please google it i'm just i'm not
00:38:09 supposed to be a source of information
00:38:10 i'm just not yeah it's not my thing you
00:38:12 just have a lot of information
00:38:14 whether it's factual or not i'm a shit
00:38:17 talker
00:38:18 that's why i'm a professional shit
00:38:19 talker i talk shit eight out of ten
00:38:21 times i don't even mean when i say
00:38:23 yeah that's the crazy thing too about
00:38:25 the internet is that
00:38:27 some people will just like assume that
00:38:29 everything you say is real and it's like
00:38:31 no there's some you know there's some
00:38:33 like i'm gonna put this up later
00:38:35 here i'll uh i'll i'll send this to you
00:38:37 jamie right now this is uh tim when he
00:38:39 was getting his covet test
00:38:42 oh my god this is something that i'm
00:38:43 sure people are gonna be pissed about
00:38:45 but
00:38:45 this is a perfect example of
00:38:48 what i like i don't need everyone to be
00:38:52 serious and or telling the truth yeah
00:38:55 and i like the fact that i can tell the
00:38:57 difference
00:38:57 and i i like when people say outrageous
00:39:00 shit that they don't really mean
00:39:01 yeah and i'm that's one of the things
00:39:03 that frustrates me the most about this
00:39:05 internet culture is that people love to
00:39:06 take
00:39:07 something like that tim dillon would say
00:39:08 in his clip and put it in quotes and
00:39:10 pretend that he really means it
00:39:12 play that and have it totally out of
00:39:13 context oh it's it's actually
00:39:16 a fairly large video should i um you got
00:39:18 it oh you got it
00:39:20 yeah put it up there and then give us
00:39:21 some volume this is uh

00:39:42 doesn't exist
00:39:44 this is outrageous i can't even put this
00:39:46 on the internet
00:39:48 it's fake oh no
00:39:50 [Laughter]
00:39:52 see now there's a lot of people that be
00:39:54 like that's jamie
00:39:58 he added his emoji but it's like
00:40:02 there's so many people that are like you

00:40:17 to be sad everything's supposed to be
00:40:19 serious
00:40:20 humorless fucks who spend all day

00:40:24 yeah but i get it because there's no
00:40:26 work yeah what are you gonna do
00:40:27 like of course it's sad but that's like
00:40:29 why comedy is so important and to make
00:40:31 light of things and be
00:40:33 ridiculous because it's like there needs
00:40:35 to be a balance for sure
00:40:37 it's that's what we do yeah and it's
00:40:38 also like what we enjoy
00:40:40 like one of the things about the comedy
00:40:41 store is that i enjoyed the most is like
00:40:43 going there
00:40:43 and people go like talk shit to you you
00:40:45 really wearing that like what
00:40:47 you are you really wearing that and then
00:40:49 all suddenly it'd be like a roast fest
00:40:51 you'd be standing there
00:40:52 what did i do yeah and then just
00:40:53 shitting on my clothes or shitting on my
00:40:55 shoes or
00:40:56 you know it's like it's fun it's fun
00:40:58 like and saying things you don't mean
00:41:00 are fun i remember when it was like me

00:41:46 cheek
00:41:47 no no like a little star like i i have
00:41:50 thought about a face
00:41:50 right above your eyebrow like a tiny
00:41:52 little one over here
00:41:54 maybe there's been multiple face tattoos
00:41:56 on this podcast

00:42:03 forgot a prominent one
00:42:04 the first one though was kat von d she
00:42:06 was number one
00:42:08 and she has a gang of them she's got
00:42:09 little stars all over the place

00:42:32 he's so cool
00:42:33 he's such a sweetheart of a person too

00:42:44 just like drawing over old tattoos like
00:42:46 new writing
00:42:46 yeah like do you think he'd get like a
00:42:49 skin graft just so he can do like a new
00:42:51 well he's actually had skin grafts
00:42:52 because he had a plane crash
00:42:54 yeah yeah um i don't think he would skin
00:42:58 gaps are fucking painful
00:42:59 yeah yeah but he's have you got
00:43:01 everything covered yeah that was skin
00:43:03 graft once uh
00:43:05 um he's got uh literally them everywhere
00:43:09 he's got them everywhere i mean yeah
00:43:10 yeah everywhere like top of his head
00:43:13 all the way down his hands his arms his
00:43:16 legs
00:43:17 everything's tattooed like see see if we

00:43:24 playing blackjack right now i'm like
00:43:26 should i
00:43:28 quit look he's out of space damn
00:43:31 it's everywhere under his chin there's
00:43:33 still some face room
00:43:35 yeah some cheeks well there was a fake
00:43:38 picture that somebody
00:43:40 might have been him that he posted of
00:43:41 his face fully tattooed is like damn he
00:43:43 might have went all in
00:43:45 but it was fake how old were you when
00:43:47 you got your first tattoo
00:43:51 23 maybe do you remember what it was
00:43:54 yeah i still have it it's like a demon
00:43:56 with a jester's
00:43:57 hat on nice stupid i know all my tattoos
00:44:01 are so stupid it's there to remind me
00:44:02 that i used to be a moron
00:44:03 yeah i feel like that's what these are
00:44:05 i'm like you know what you're gonna be a
00:44:06 different person well i'm still a moron
00:44:08 but i'm
00:44:09 i'm definitely less of a moron than when
00:44:11 i was 23. yeah
00:44:13 that's why it's that's why uh
00:44:16 that's why i really liked like being at
00:44:18 the store and like having people like
00:44:20 you
00:44:20 and tony and santino and just like all
00:44:22 the people there
00:44:23 like you know because for me being a
00:44:26 young person in comedy i'm always like
00:44:28 were you guys like bad when you first
00:44:30 started oh we were terrible i'm like did
00:44:32 you guys know what you wanted to talk
00:44:33 about
00:44:34 and it's so cool being able to like ask
00:44:36 you guys for advice and like
00:44:38 have these mentors well it's also the
00:44:41 the guys you're talking about everyone's
00:44:43 genuinely honest
00:44:45 like they'll tell you the times they
00:44:47 bombed like the worst is people that
00:44:49 don't admit they bomb
00:44:50 or don't admit when they bombed because
00:44:52 like okay you're protecting yourself
00:44:54 and you're damaging our relationship
00:44:55 yeah by protecting yourself first of all
00:44:57 it doesn't really work
00:44:58 you're not really protecting yourself
00:44:59 and two you're damaging our relationship
00:45:01 because now i can't listen to you
00:45:02 because now i know i think you're full
00:45:03 of shit yeah that's not good
00:45:07 remember i remember when we were in st
00:45:10 paul
00:45:10 and in the arena and i said what's up st
00:45:16 louis
00:45:18 that was rough oh my god you barely
00:45:21 recovered from that one
00:45:22 i thought i was gonna get burned alive
00:45:24 after the show they got mad
00:45:25 and i opened it up i was the first one
00:45:27 on stage i was like so excited i'm like
00:45:29 what's up
00:45:30 oh no dead silence and i'm like
00:45:34 that's not how this works oh no yeah
00:45:37 oh but then i recovered thank god i
00:45:39 think i've done that before i think i
00:45:40 called
00:45:41 minneapolis michigan once yeah i retired
00:45:45 saying what's up wherever i'm
00:45:46 at i'm like i'll just get into it well
00:45:50 there's some places that demand respect
00:45:52 like if you go to new york and you call
00:45:53 it philly your show's over
00:45:54 yeah what's up philly what they would
00:45:57 just
00:45:59 that's a mistake you can't make boo
00:46:03 some mistakes you can't make but if you
00:46:05 call st
00:46:06 paul st louis you're like oh my god i'm
00:46:07 a fucking idiot like a couple minutes
00:46:09 later if you have some good jokes

00:46:11 yeah new york will never forgive you if
00:46:13 you call it philadelphia if you call new
00:46:14 york philadelphia or if you call
00:46:16 philadelphia new york

00:46:19 the difference between philly and new

00:46:24 with the booze and everything else
00:46:26 um i stopped everything
00:46:29 uh the day after halloween of 2015. was
00:46:32 it a rough halloween it was a rough
00:46:34 halloween
00:46:35 yeah not one of my best moments so 2000
00:46:38 you were 19 then
00:46:39 i was 19. i think i was 20.
00:46:42 yeah so right around that yeah because i
00:46:45 yeah
00:46:46 i um i woke up half naked on my dad's
00:46:49 couch
00:46:49 and i was like this is not the way i
00:46:51 want to be waking up
00:46:53 this is not a pretty sight were you out
00:46:56 all night or
00:46:57 yeah and i was like i was moving to l.a
00:47:00 november 1st 2015 and i was like okay i
00:47:03 still want to go out for halloween but i
00:47:04 like need to be respectful
00:47:06 no no hard alcohol just like a couple
00:47:09 beers
00:47:10 get your shit together don't be a piece
00:47:12 of shit blacked
00:47:13 out amazing woke up half naked so
00:47:15 whenever people are like how long have
00:47:16 you lived in la i'm like
00:47:18 uh four years seven months
00:47:21 you know whatever days right you can get
00:47:23 it down to the alcoholics anonymous
00:47:25 chips yes yes yes
00:47:27 yeah jim norton's the same way yeah
00:47:29 norton stopped when he was 19.
00:47:30 oh really yep yep you realize he's like
00:47:32 i i'm a fucking mess and i can't do this
00:47:35 and i thought when i started
00:47:36 comedy i was like i was like everyone
00:47:39 who is successful drinks like it's just
00:47:41 part of it like you have to be boozing
00:47:42 and schmoozing and like having a good
00:47:44 time after the show and like partying it
00:47:46 up and have this like rock star
00:47:49 attitude and then i realized that there
00:47:51 were so many
00:47:52 successful comedians who don't drink and
00:47:54 i was like okay maybe this is like
00:47:56 possible
00:47:57 yeah oh it's very possible yeah and
00:47:58 hicks did his best work after he cleaned
00:48:00 up
00:48:01 yeah he didn't you know didn't do
00:48:03 anything yeah
00:48:04 when he was like in his 30
00:48:07 i think he quit like at like 30 or
00:48:09 something like that
00:48:11 but then whatever he had done caught up
00:48:12 to him already but he smoked a lot of
00:48:14 cigarettes which is
00:48:15 just as bad my friend yeah he's your
00:48:18 favorite right here's your favorite yeah
00:48:20 no no he's not my favorite um he's not
00:48:23 the funniest
00:48:25 he was a a great mind and i think he had
00:48:28 really interesting thoughts and i think
00:48:31 that his comedy
00:48:32 was very revolutionary in that it
00:48:35 changed the way people thought about
00:48:36 doing comedy
00:48:37 like because you could do comedy and
00:48:38 talk about important issues
00:48:40 you could talk about complex things yeah
00:48:42 and it inspired me to talk about more
00:48:44 complex things
00:48:45 but kennison but you didn't start out
00:48:47 talking about
00:48:48 complex things did you no okay thank god
00:48:52 because i'm like my my ass whatever
00:48:55 my jokes are fucking dick doing whatever
00:48:58 you know the dumb shit of course and i'm
00:49:00 always like i hope i'm
00:49:01 i mean i don't mind if i keep talking
00:49:03 about whatever like dumb shit i just
00:49:05 wanted to be like
00:49:06 a little bit more elevated well some
00:49:08 people talk about dumb shit for
00:49:10 ever and it's great yeah it does you
00:49:12 don't there's no rules it just has to be
00:49:14 funny
00:49:14 i used to be so insecure you know about
00:49:17 you know my dumb jokes which i think are
00:49:19 funny but they're you know the co
00:49:21 it's not like i'm breaking boundaries or
00:49:23 like opening people's minds to
00:49:24 you know the people that want to do that
00:49:27 all suck
00:49:28 the people that want to break boundaries
00:49:30 yeah people want to open people's minds
00:49:31 like
00:49:32 they're almost always annoying yeah like
00:49:33 i think the jokes
00:49:35 should be well there's two things that
00:49:36 should be possible right
00:49:38 first of all what you're saying for the
00:49:41 people in the audience should be
00:49:42 entertaining
00:49:42 should be interesting that was one of
00:49:44 the things that hicks said like just try
00:49:45 to be
00:49:46 try to be interesting he had like a see
00:49:48 if he can find this he had like a rules
00:49:50 to comedy thing that he wrote that's
00:49:52 very insightful it's really interesting
00:49:54 when you think about the guy died i
00:49:56 think he was only like 33
00:49:58 when he died yeah he was just really
00:50:01 fucking smart
00:50:02 yeah you know we're just really smart
00:50:04 and
00:50:05 also started comedy really young so here
00:50:08 it is
00:50:09 bill hicks principles of comedy if you
00:50:11 can be yourself on stage
00:50:13 nobody else can be you and you have the
00:50:15 law of supply and demand covered
00:50:18 your the act is something you fall back
00:50:20 on if you can't think of anything else
00:50:21 to say
00:50:23 number three only what only do what you
00:50:26 think is funny
00:50:27 never just what you think they will like
00:50:29 even though it's not that funny to you
00:50:33 number four never ask them is this funny
00:50:36 you tell them this is funny number five
00:50:38 you are not married to any of this shit
00:50:40 if something happens
00:50:42 taking off on a tangent never go back
00:50:44 and finish a bit
00:50:45 just move on number six never ask the
00:50:48 audience
00:50:49 how you doing people who do that can't
00:50:52 think of an opening line
00:50:53 they came to see you tell them how
00:50:55 they're doing asking that stupid
00:50:57 question up front just digs a hole
00:50:59 this is the most common mistake i like
00:51:01 how he wrote that in all caps
00:51:02 this is the most common mistake with uh
00:51:05 well not all caps
00:51:06 front word first letter caps the most
00:51:09 common mistake made by performers
00:51:11 i want to leave as soon as they say that
00:51:13 number seven
00:51:14 write what entertains you if you can't
00:51:17 be funny be interesting that's what i
00:51:18 was talking about
00:51:19 you haven't lost the crowd have
00:51:21 something to say and then do it in a
00:51:22 funny way
00:51:23 number eight i close my eyes and walk
00:51:25 out there and that's where i start
00:51:27 honest number nine listen to what you
00:51:30 are saying
00:51:31 ask yourself why am i saying it and is
00:51:34 it necessary this will
00:51:36 filter all your material and cut the
00:51:39 unnecessary words
00:51:41 economy of words you're super into that
00:51:43 economy awards is everything it's
00:51:44 everything with jokes
00:51:45 number 10 play to the top of the
00:51:47 intelligence the room
00:51:49 there aren't any bad crowds just wrong
00:51:51 choices that's not true
00:51:52 yeah that's just not true there are
00:51:54 definitely bad crowds
00:51:56 number 11 remember this is the hardest
00:51:58 thing there is to do
00:51:59 that's not true being a soldier way
00:52:01 fucking harder
00:52:02 if you can do this you can do anything
00:52:04 nope you can't tell
00:52:06 people jokes and then do brain surgery i
00:52:08 can't do shit yeah that's not true i'm
00:52:10 useless
00:52:10 number 12 i love my cracker roots get to
00:52:13 know your family
00:52:14 be friends with them well that's not the
00:52:16 worst advice
00:52:17 but although all the the thing that is a
00:52:20 problem with any of that stuff
00:52:21 is this is how you do it the beautiful
00:52:23 thing about comedy is there is no
00:52:25 this is how you do it yeah like there's
00:52:27 mitch hedberg and there's sand kinnison
00:52:29 those are two all-time greats there's
00:52:31 richard pryor
00:52:33 and there's louis ck there's dave
00:52:35 chappelle and there's emo phillips
00:52:37 there's bobcat gold wade and there's
00:52:39 fucking
00:52:40 you know i mean you can do that all day
00:52:42 i think that just goes back to like just
00:52:44 be who you are on stage yes
00:52:46 yes but also do what you feel like doing
00:52:48 like
00:52:49 gaff again likes to do his kind of
00:52:51 comedy yeah right if all of a sudden
00:52:53 gaffigan had to do
00:52:54 like uh you know someone else's act like
00:52:57 bobby lee or something like that like it
00:52:59 wouldn't be
00:53:00 it's not what he's interested in you
00:53:01 know he
00:53:03 you find what you like to do it's like
00:53:05 some people are country music stars
00:53:07 some people are rappers you know like
00:53:09 everyone's got their own thing
00:53:11 and that's the thing with like comedy is
00:53:13 i feel like when you're starting out
00:53:16 it can feel so like competitive or
00:53:19 um like should i be doing what this
00:53:22 person's doing because they're doing
00:53:23 things or whatever but
00:53:24 i i feel like i have to look at it like
00:53:26 music it's like oh i like a rapper and i
00:53:29 also like this
00:53:30 like corny pop musician they're in
00:53:32 totally different lanes they're not
00:53:34 competing against each other they're not
00:53:35 looking at each other being like
00:53:37 why are they doing that they're doing
00:53:38 their own thing and i can appreciate
00:53:40 both
00:53:41 artists or both songs or whatever you
00:53:44 know what i mean
00:53:44 i do know what you mean but some people
00:53:46 can't and some comics can't some comics
00:53:48 decide that they don't
00:53:49 like what you do so you shouldn't be
00:53:52 doing it yeah they get angry yeah you
00:53:54 know you shouldn't be talking about sex
00:53:55 you should be talking about you know
00:53:57 like whatever observed things yeah but
00:54:00 that's like because comedy
00:54:02 is if you go to a comedy club it's just
00:54:05 a comedy club
00:54:06 nobody goes to a music club and doesn't
00:54:09 know what kind of band is playing
00:54:11 if you go to see rock and roll and uh
00:54:13 all of a sudden a
00:54:14 folk singer shows up you get upset yeah
00:54:16 like there's no other venue
00:54:18 like that where like someone will call
00:54:20 on stage in their metallica
00:54:21 and then right afterwards would be like
00:54:24 sarah mclaughlin yeah
00:54:25 that's a weird combination but in comedy
00:54:27 that's a combination that exists
00:54:28 all the time you will see weird
00:54:31 combinations like that all the time
00:54:33 where
00:54:33 if you're on a 10 person show like at
00:54:35 the store where 10 people are doing 15
00:54:37 minute sets
00:54:38 you are likely to see the full spectrum
00:54:40 of comedy yeah
00:54:42 all kinds of weird shit that's why i
00:54:44 like the original room so much
00:54:46 because it goes until you know two in
00:54:47 the morning sometimes longer and you get
00:54:49 to see the weirdest
00:54:51 stuff and yeah well that's where i saw
00:54:53 laura laura beets yeah
00:54:55 i mean and i became a giant fan of hers
00:54:57 and i put the post on my instagram
00:55:00 because
00:55:00 me and christie we did a show this big
00:55:03 ass sold out show in the main room
00:55:05 and then bert and i sat down in the back
00:55:06 of the room and laura was on stage and
00:55:08 there was like
00:55:09 maybe i mean 15 people or something
00:55:13 something like that a small ass crowd
00:55:15 by the time she was off stage the crowd
00:55:17 had doubled yeah because they were
00:55:18 coming in
00:55:19 to sit down to listen to her and that
00:55:22 doesn't seem like a lot you know there's
00:55:23 only 30 people but
00:55:24 that's a big jump yeah and for the or at
00:55:27 like whatever time that was
00:55:29 she's so talented she's so funny and
00:55:32 just so
00:55:33 like ah yeah i love her style and it's
00:55:36 like what he was saying she's herself
00:55:37 yeah she knows how to do it and
00:55:39 she works so hard like her and i talked
00:55:41 about writing and she showed me her
00:55:42 notebook
00:55:43 first of all everything is like there's
00:55:44 like a line and then a space
00:55:46 like she she's like leaves a whole line
00:55:48 bear and then the next space i'm like oh
00:55:50 you're fucking organized as fuck
00:55:52 yeah she's like yes i'm serious i have a
00:55:54 friend who
00:55:55 her notes are color-coded she has it
00:55:58 like color-coded jokes that like really
00:56:00 work
00:56:00 jokes that need some work on them brand
00:56:03 new jokes and then like certain parts of
00:56:05 the joke are color coded differently and
00:56:06 i'm like my brain does not work like
00:56:08 that did she use highlights or she used
00:56:10 tabs
00:56:10 she she does it on her computer and
00:56:12 phone yeah
00:56:13 and then like when she's doing a show i
00:56:15 think she just like transfers what she
00:56:16 wants to do into the notebook
00:56:18 oh interesting yeah well everybody's got
00:56:21 their own
00:56:21 interesting way of doing it ron funch
00:56:23 said something really interesting
00:56:24 i heard i was just like right ron was
00:56:27 like
00:56:27 write what you love you hate and then
00:56:30 what you fear i was like
00:56:32 oh and i texted him after the podcast i
00:56:35 go i ask that question all the time
00:56:37 like what's your process rarely do i get
00:56:39 an answer that makes me go
00:56:41 oh i'm gonna implement that and so
00:56:44 i told him that i mean i know it's
00:56:45 probably a standard writing exercise but
00:56:48 i i wasn't aware of it yeah it's
00:56:49 probably just a great way to
00:56:51 really figure out your perspective on
00:56:53 things and figure out your like
00:56:54 uh point of view and the angle that you
00:56:57 want to take for a bit it seems like the
00:56:59 perfect combination because you always
00:57:00 want to combine those three things yeah
00:57:02 what scares the fuck out of me what i
00:57:03 love
00:57:04 and what i hate yeah those things are
00:57:06 awesome together
00:57:07 that really is comedy it's a very smart
00:57:09 way to write i was like that
00:57:10 that made a big difference yeah i just
00:57:12 can't wait till it fucking opens up
00:57:14 again
00:57:14 i know i feel like i'm in retirement i'm
00:57:16 like do i go to palm springs and
00:57:18 [Music]
00:57:19 well i was saying people like you you're
00:57:22 in the middle of your development
00:57:24 this is when the party's happening this
00:57:26 is when everything's rocking and rolling
00:57:27 and you get shut down right i was saying
00:57:29 the chappelle lacy the same thing
00:57:31 like here you are in the middle
00:57:32 everything's starting to rock and roll
00:57:33 and kicking up and
00:57:35 you're starting to do sets and it's
00:57:36 picking up and it's picking up and it's
00:57:37 picking up
00:57:38 and all of a sudden boom i know i was i
00:57:40 did my first headlining show
00:57:42 and then i was on my way to do my second
00:57:44 headlining weekend uh
00:57:46 in denver at comedy works and then the
00:57:48 day that i got there
00:57:49 things got really crazy and they were
00:57:50 talking about the la lockdown and i was
00:57:52 like i don't know what that means like i
00:57:53 can't do the rest of the shows here
00:57:55 so then i flew home cancelled the rest
00:57:57 of the shows oh you were worried that
00:57:59 they were going to lock down where you
00:58:00 can't fly
00:58:00 yeah i think i texted you i was like i
00:58:02 don't know what to do like i'm already
00:58:03 here i feel bad
00:58:04 canceling like i don't know it's one of
00:58:07 those
00:58:08 things where where it was it was really
00:58:10 obvious that everything was going to
00:58:11 cancel
00:58:12 because we were at the store and i was
00:58:13 supposed to do the main room
00:58:15 and uh i think i was doing the main room
00:58:18 i think it was more than one show
00:58:19 it might have been two minutes yeah i
00:58:20 was supposed to host yeah and then
00:58:22 they called me up and they said hey the
00:58:24 state is putting up
00:58:26 um they're making a limitation so you
00:58:28 can only have 200 people in a room and
00:58:30 obviously the main room is bigger than
00:58:31 that so
00:58:32 we're going to shut the shows down i'm
00:58:33 like yeah it's probably a good idea like
00:58:35 do you do you
00:58:36 uh would would you rather do the or
00:58:38 we'll move your shirt to the or
00:58:40 move as many people there as you can and
00:58:41 i'm like i don't know if we should do
00:58:43 shows
00:58:44 yeah i was like what do we do what if we
00:58:46 all get sick
00:58:47 yeah you know and that was in the early
00:58:49 days when no one knew what it was
00:58:51 and what's gonna happen to us and i was
00:58:53 in vegas
00:58:55 i think it was like first week of march
00:58:57 that was the last
00:58:58 time we had a vegas show with a live
00:59:01 audience it was this
00:59:02 packed t-mobile arena and i remember
00:59:05 thinking like this
00:59:06 this feels weird like people were on the
00:59:08 plane
00:59:09 some had masks some didn't this guy
00:59:11 wanted to shake my hand
00:59:12 and i was like i'll shake your hand he's
00:59:13 like you sure i'm like yeah
00:59:15 i'm still shaking hands it was like
00:59:17 march 7th or something yeah
00:59:19 crazy yeah here we are i think it's been
00:59:22 like so
00:59:23 unorganized with how to handle it and
00:59:25 that's why i think there's so much
00:59:27 like uh resistance towards doing things
00:59:30 now
00:59:30 well it's like they didn't know no one
00:59:32 knew yeah
00:59:34 it's i was saying this on the podcast
00:59:36 the other day
00:59:37 when you become a governor you don't
00:59:39 become a governor because you pass a
00:59:40 bunch of tests that show that you
00:59:42 accurately know how to handle each and
00:59:44 every situation yeah you become a
00:59:46 governor because you're popular you win
00:59:47 a popularity contest you back the right
00:59:49 bills you say the right things you got
00:59:50 the best hair
00:59:51 and people like i like them let's see if
00:59:53 he can run shit and then
00:59:54 something like this happens and you
00:59:56 realize like oh these motherfuckers
00:59:58 they don't know what they're doing yeah
01:00:00 this is just guesswork and like
01:00:01 we're going on science no you're not
01:00:04 yeah
01:00:04 stop saying that you're not going
01:00:06 outside because if you were you'd be
01:00:07 telling people to take vitamin d
01:00:08 you'd be telling people to take zinc
01:00:10 you'd be telling people large doses of
01:00:11 vitamin c you'd be handing that shit out
01:00:13 you'd be on every corner people be able
01:00:14 to get vitamin d vitamin c and zinc
01:00:17 you pass it out you know you don't know
01:00:18 what you're doing is that the magic
01:00:20 that's a big combination vitamin d
01:00:23 vitamin c
01:00:24 and zinc the but the virus apparently
01:00:26 has a very difficult time replicating in
01:00:28 your system when you have all those
01:00:29 things
01:00:30 and this is all they don't know why
01:00:33 they don't exactly know what's the what
01:00:36 the deal is
01:00:37 but there's some direct evidence that
01:00:39 points to that including a bunch of
01:00:40 studies that have been done on people
01:00:41 that are in the icu
01:00:43 or more than 80 of them in the icu have
01:00:45 low levels of vitamin d
01:00:46 insufficient levels of vitamin d only
01:00:49 four percent have sufficient levels
01:00:50 vitamin d
01:00:51 the sun one yes okay that's one that we
01:00:53 have a real problem with i've been going
01:00:54 to the beach a lot
01:00:56 well that's good you need to take it too
01:00:58 though oh unfortunately because we're
01:01:00 really supposed to be outside all day
01:01:01 these all this house shit that's not
01:01:04 really uh
01:01:04 nature doesn't know what we're doing
01:01:06 yeah nature's like why are you bitches
01:01:07 where's your son
01:01:08 yeah like we're designed to get sun
01:01:11 all the time i always think about your
01:01:13 joke you know when there's certain
01:01:15 people i've told you this before but
01:01:17 there's certain jokes that just always
01:01:18 stand out to you like you always just
01:01:19 kind of like think about them
01:01:21 the joke about uh about houses and how
01:01:25 underwater there's no houses there's
01:01:26 nowhere to hide oh yeah
01:01:28 yeah yeah that's the most dangerous
01:01:31 neighborhood
01:01:31 yeah the world is the ocean yeah cause
01:01:33 there's no indoors but it's so true it's
01:01:35 like
01:01:36 houses are such a weird concept like
01:01:38 obviously they make sense
01:01:39 but like it is a weird concept to be
01:01:41 like this is my safe space
01:01:43 don't enter there's locks on the door i
01:01:44 have my own bedroom in my house so the
01:01:46 people in my house can't come in
01:01:47 well that's why human beings have
01:01:49 figured out a way to manipulate the
01:01:50 entire world
01:01:51 whereas whereas uh
01:01:54 people in the ocean like uh dolphins
01:01:56 ocean people
01:01:58 they never figured it out they have no
01:01:59 they never rest
01:02:01 yeah there was a shark ah octopus ah
01:02:04 they're always just running away from
01:02:05 shit yeah
01:02:06 they never have a chance to sit down
01:02:07 close the door and go what the fuck am i
01:02:09 doing with my life
01:02:10 like that's what you have when you have
01:02:11 a living room and a gun you can shut the
01:02:13 door
01:02:14 and you feel a little bit safe and you
01:02:15 can start thinking about things like
01:02:17 people had to develop weapons and they
01:02:18 had to develop
01:02:19 housing yeah they had to develop shelter
01:02:21 they had they had to figure out where to
01:02:22 stockpile food and that's that's how we
01:02:24 figured out how to become human yeah
01:02:26 but until then we were basically like
01:02:28 the smartest animals
01:02:29 we were the animals that figured out how
01:02:31 to use tools and now we're just dumb
01:02:34 now we're just soft jelly
01:02:38 little fucking bags of water i don't
01:02:41 drink enough water
01:02:43 why not i don't know it's free i know
01:02:45 drink it
01:02:46 i'm gonna just drink all these make a
01:02:49 deal with your mom
01:02:50 you drink water i'll stop smoking yeah i
01:02:53 mean she's gonna listen to this episode

01:03:15 been divorced since i was like five or
01:03:17 six
01:03:17 and they have the same job that's funny
01:03:20 every once in a while they'll work
01:03:21 together and send a selfie to me and my
01:03:23 sisters
01:03:23 there was something that i tweeted today
01:03:25 that says marijuana
01:03:26 stops people from getting coveted
01:03:30 that can't be real it was going around
01:03:32 early i'll see if it's the same thing
01:03:34 that was happening
01:03:36 i bet tommy chong wrote it under a pen
01:03:37 name that's probably fake
01:03:41 so when do you decide to pull out the
01:03:42 real cancer-causing cigarette
01:03:44 and leave the jewel alone me
01:03:48 yeah sometimes i stop at all no
01:03:49 sometimes you smoke cigarettes
01:03:51 may 18th 2020. new canadian study
01:03:55 reportedly says marijuana may prevent
01:03:57 the coronavirus
01:03:58 aha yeah it said that they had like uh
01:04:00 one strain
01:04:01 of a sativa i believe i remember reading
01:04:03 this back then that like might have some
01:04:06 i don't know something yeah i would say
01:04:08 it was like let's let's study this
01:04:09 though please study it because
01:04:12 this is probably dumb but does it when
01:04:15 you smoke
01:04:16 anything marijuana cigarettes whatever
01:04:18 does that go into your bloodstream or
01:04:19 just your lungs
01:04:21 it goes into your bloodstream from your
01:04:22 lungs yeah strong object
01:04:24 update strong objection to the believe
01:04:27 treatment has been extended to the
01:04:29 source

01:06:39 yeah weird no tick tock back then though
01:06:43 huh
01:06:43 what if she's bored i know you could
01:06:45 have been a tick-tock superstar
01:06:46 maybe you would have got started being
01:06:48 professional tick-tockers
01:06:49 because some people who are just
01:06:51 professional tick-tockers
01:06:53 they they actually make a living oh yeah
01:06:55 oh yeah a good living too
01:06:57 dancing yeah just fucking tick-tock yeah
01:07:00 it's all the rage so what happens
01:07:01 how do you get money uh you i think you
01:07:04 reach enough followers and likes where
01:07:07 companies start coming in
01:07:08 and being like we can profit off of
01:07:10 putting something in your video and
01:07:12 making money off of you
01:07:13 and then apparently you know they have
01:07:16 enough talent to be in like
01:07:17 super bowl commercials and whatever so
01:07:21 you i really like tick tock i know you
01:07:23 do i can tell oh my god this guy is 79
01:07:25 million
01:07:26 girl it's the top girl in there who who
01:07:28 is it oh you've got she got it with skin
01:07:30 like that's charlie dimelio

01:07:38 followers and now youtube channel they
01:07:39 have a makeup line
01:07:40 dude it went first of all i apologize
01:07:43 for calling her a dude
01:07:44 because all i saw was the number yeah
01:07:46 yeah i had it i don't know why i assumed
01:07:48 it was a guy
01:07:48 probably because i'm sexist but that uh
01:07:51 that one
01:07:52 in the beginning that first video that
01:07:54 you just played i don't know the first
01:07:55 one to the left where she's tick talking
01:07:57 when she's dancing and moving
01:07:58 yeah like in the future right if you
01:08:01 were watching a movie
01:08:03 where that was made in like the 1980s
01:08:05 about how fucked up the world would be
01:08:06 in 2020
01:08:07 yeah and you this was like something
01:08:10 that just millions and millions and
01:08:11 millions of people would be into just
01:08:13 seeing
01:08:13 people do this but here's the thing with
01:08:15 tick tock
01:08:16 sure everyone knows about the dancing
01:08:19 and the lip singing
01:08:20 and whatever but the thing that i like
01:08:23 about tick tock is that
01:08:25 that your main feed is based on videos
01:08:28 you like so if you're not
01:08:29 liking dance videos you're not going to
01:08:31 see dance videos on your feed oh what
01:08:33 will you say
01:08:33 and it's not based on people you follow
01:08:35 this is how old i am and how little i
01:08:36 know about tiktok no i
01:08:37 thought it was all people doing this no
01:08:39 i finally get to teach joe something
01:08:40 they don't you haven't seen christina
01:08:42 pizzki's curations no
01:08:44 she has a whole different very like
01:08:46 version of what tick-tock oh my god her
01:08:47 tick-tock algorithm
01:08:48 scares the shit out of me what does she
01:08:50 do on tock she doesn't
01:08:52 she has a tick tock she posts a lot of
01:08:53 like ymh clips on there and stuff
01:08:55 but she posts what her feed looks like
01:08:58 on
01:08:59 her stories on instagram and it'll be
01:09:01 like the most
01:09:02 country like bumpkin type of people no
01:09:05 teeth like
01:09:06 kissing their brothers and sisters like
01:09:08 it's wild
01:09:09 is that because of stuff she posts or
01:09:11 it's because of the stuff that she likes
01:09:13 i think she likes that weird
01:09:15 like deep like southern yeah
01:09:18 part of tick tock which that's funny
01:09:20 well they love

01:14:56 they'll they'll do a song and in the
01:14:57 song it'll say like
01:14:59 my heart beats and then the dance is
01:15:00 like you're pretty much doing like

01:15:31 there's these young everyone's on it and
01:15:34 there's young people there's old people
01:15:36 but like
01:15:37 there'll be songs that are like yeah

01:15:40 and then the dance to that is like
01:15:42 you're putting your hand above
01:15:44 where a dick would be and then you're
01:15:46 doing like a bouncing motion
01:15:48 and there's like 13 year old girls doing
01:15:50 this
01:15:51 and i'm just like ah there's there's
01:15:54 creepy people
01:15:56 and i want to say like i want to stop it
01:15:58 but you can't
01:16:00 and i've also been like you know i've
01:16:01 been a middle schooler on
01:16:03 weird websites where there's like creepy
01:16:05 dudes like there's this website called
01:16:06 omegle
01:16:07 and you can talk to complete strangers
01:16:09 it's kind of like chat roulette
01:16:11 and i was on that when i was in middle
01:16:12 school and like now that i'm an adult
01:16:14 i'm like why was i
01:16:15 ever on there you know who does um those
01:16:18 kind of stings
01:16:19 where they uh they play pretend that
01:16:21 they're a little kid and then
01:16:22 set people up yeah set up uh pedophiles
01:16:25 shaquille o'neal
01:16:27 what yes wait he dresses like a girl no
01:16:30 he goes on chat rooms and pretends he's
01:16:33 a a
01:16:34 young girl like for fun no to get catch
01:16:37 pedophiles
01:16:38 whoa yeah he was telling me he did that
01:16:40 he he's like a legit
01:16:42 sheriff's deputy yeah where is shaquille
01:16:45 o'neal he's like a sheriff's deputy or
01:16:47 something i don't know if he still
01:16:48 is and he's also a dj he's also the
01:16:50 biggest human i've ever met in my life
01:16:53 he's so big he did fear factor with me
01:16:55 and it was like me
01:16:56 like i was with my dad like uh he was
01:16:59 like a six-year-old with his dad he's so
01:17:01 big he's like three two one
01:17:04 go he has to have a huge dick right here
01:17:07 even if it's regular size he's so big it
01:17:09 has to be ridiculous
01:17:10 yeah when he did that he was still uh
01:17:14 in the nba that was in 2005 in roanoke
01:17:16 virginia but
01:17:17 he is a resident in
01:17:20 georgia where he is an honorary deputy
01:17:22 in clayton county
01:17:24 yeah so an honorary deputy that's like
01:17:26 being an honorary
01:17:27 graduate student from usc yes it's not
01:17:31 totally he's not like you know whipping
01:17:33 out a pistol and driving down the
01:17:35 freeway
01:17:36 you probably have to do something yeah
01:17:38 and i think it allows you to carry a gun
01:17:40 a lot of places you couldn't ordinarily
01:17:42 he said he's actually going to run for
01:17:43 sheriff but this was a couple years ago
01:17:45 so like this would be now
01:17:47 he's a super nice guy he's so big though
01:17:50 yeah like it's interesting that a guy
01:17:53 that big is actually too big for
01:17:54 fighting
01:17:56 because the ufc doesn't have a super
01:17:58 heavyweight weight class look at the
01:17:59 size of him
01:18:00 oh my god his head looks so small
01:18:04 there's one guy because he's far away
01:18:07 there's a guy who makes him look
01:18:08 i'll show you a picture hot yeah that's
01:18:11 ridiculous
01:18:13 yeah humans come in all sorts of sizes
01:18:15 we're like dogs
01:18:16 yeah you know that's how i like going to
01:18:18 the spa like the korean spa
01:18:20 because you get to see everyone naked
01:18:21 and you're like oh my body's not that
01:18:22 weird
01:18:23 what's that gentleman yeah and how tall
01:18:25 is yao
01:18:27 7776 somewhere in there that is
01:18:29 crazy damn seven seven
01:18:32 from china he made china big huge in the
01:18:35 nba and this is
01:18:36 him and the smallest guy in the nba
01:18:37 fight wow
01:18:40 that guy's so cute that's crazy
01:18:43 he's so enormous genetics are weird
01:18:46 i mean that's and it's interesting that
01:18:48 he's chinese like because there's a
01:18:50 bunch of really tall guys from china
01:18:51 right
01:18:52 a few there's quite a few like when did
01:18:56 that start
01:18:56 when did dudes from china start being
01:18:58 giant
01:19:01 and coordinated i don't know would do
01:19:03 you know what i'm saying like
01:19:04 if you look at like specific body types
01:19:07 there's like places that you recognize
01:19:09 as having like
01:19:10 enormous body type that's why i was
01:19:11 saying that because they're they're and
01:19:13 coordinated i added because
01:19:15 uh it would be going to like scouting
01:19:16 and recruiting because you would have to
01:19:18 there's a movie shaq was in called blue
01:19:20 chips in the 90s that like
01:19:22 you went and found the guy and then
01:19:23 which is what they do in the nba now
01:19:25 you can make some guy from like africa
01:19:28 for instance
01:19:28 who doesn't know how to play like the
01:19:30 entertain excuse me onto the koopa
01:19:31 brothers who came from africa went to
01:19:33 greece
01:19:34 tall giant skinny uncoordinated
01:19:37 but have athletic ability way more than
01:19:40 anybody could ever do so if you can get
01:19:41 them to shoot a little bit get them
01:19:43 practice and shooting
01:19:44 they can be the best basketball players
01:19:45 of all time which you're seeing actually
01:19:46 right now
01:19:47 with one of them he's only like 24 and
01:19:50 he is
01:19:51 they call him the greek freak he's an
01:19:53 insane basketball player
01:19:54 and his little brothers are now like
01:19:55 getting recruited and put on every team
01:19:57 interesting
01:19:58 if you find somebody deep in like
01:20:00 wherever i don't know where they're
01:20:01 finding people in china but like there's
01:20:02 probably some people
01:20:03 deep in russia or who knows where yeah i
01:20:05 wonder what that is though
01:20:06 like what what what is it about a
01:20:08 certain group of people like when you
01:20:09 see like um
01:20:10 people from iceland and those giant um
01:20:13 strongman competition dudes
01:20:15 so many of them are from iceland but
01:20:17 that makes sense look at the size that

01:20:39 like how are you a real fan yeah
01:20:40 he's so big like he's so jacked too what
01:20:43 a crazy career trajectory
01:20:45 listen that guy works hard he works
01:20:48 hard when you look at someone like the
01:20:51 rock are you like i need to stop my game
01:20:52 yes
01:20:53 always always look at that what the fuck
01:20:55 is that look at his body
01:20:57 that's too much no no no that's the
01:20:59 right amount
01:21:00 i like scrawny little like dude and he
01:21:03 wears cowboy boots too or some shit
01:21:05 he's so big but he's also like insanely
01:21:08 disciplined he's not just an enormous
01:21:10 human being
01:21:11 from just being born big he's insanely
01:21:14 disciplined yeah
01:21:15 i mean you follow his instagram feed you
01:21:17 feel really fucking lazy back at that up
01:21:19 one
01:21:21 back up where you were where you just
01:21:23 were you was there was a grid of images
01:21:25 oh my god yeah seriously scroll down to
01:21:29 that one where he doesn't have a shirt
01:21:30 keep going right there
01:21:31 with the plate what the fuck son jesus
01:21:34 that's insane but that's that makes me
01:21:37 uncomfortable
01:21:38 years and years and years and years and
01:21:41 years and years of grinding
01:21:43 that's what that is you don't get built
01:21:44 like that like sure there's some mexican
01:21:46 supplements involved in there
01:21:48 and sure there's some genetics but you
01:21:50 gotta work to get a body like that don't
01:21:52 get wha
01:21:53 like but why do you need that body shut
01:21:56 your mouth woman point of having it
01:21:58 oh my god you're such a girl like what
01:22:00 does he need to do
01:22:02 he wants to be the ultimate man look at
01:22:04 him for what
01:22:05 what are you talking about take some
01:22:06 days off chill are you kidding me
01:22:10 it's the ultimate man i guess it's a
01:22:12 fucking perfect specimen yeah for some
01:22:14 people
01:22:14 how dare you i'm sorry what are you into
01:22:17 like real emo guys who cough a lot yes
01:22:20 i like weak fragile boys yes
01:22:24 on scrawny men who want to be the baby
01:22:26 spoon
01:22:28 i want to be mama's spoon let me warm
01:22:30 you up
01:22:31 guys we're always cold yeah i think i'm
01:22:34 sick check my forehead
01:22:36 that's serious oh my god yeah yeah
01:22:38 meanwhile look at him
01:22:40 damn this fucking build on that man
01:22:44 that's a man that's a specimen
01:22:48 i get it you're into tick tockers
01:22:53 oh my god yeah i mean it's a crazy thing
01:22:55 to be like insanely dedicated to and
01:22:58 it's also
01:22:58 yeah one i mean the amount of effort
01:23:00 that guy has to put out to keep his body
01:23:02 looking like that
01:23:03 the effort's insane have you ever worked
01:23:05 out you realize like that just to
01:23:06 maintain that all the time like that the
01:23:08 way he does
01:23:09 yeah that's insane can i go pure does
01:23:11 that kill the vibe no no
01:23:12 no no no i got a this is a tick tock
01:23:15 conspiracy thing i
01:23:16 like read about i'd like to pass it by
01:23:19 you and let you know if you think it's
01:23:20 like
01:23:21 okay if this makes sense uh because
01:23:24 there's a lot of like kids on there they
01:23:25 figure out how that algorithm works to
01:23:27 make themselves get bigger on it or
01:23:30 whatnot so they say that
01:23:32 if you start a new account one of the
01:23:33 first things they'll do with one of your
01:23:34 first couple posts is they'll almost
01:23:36 make it go viral
01:23:37 so they'll i don't know how that they
01:23:39 send it out to more people or whatnot
01:23:40 but you have a video that then baits you
01:23:44 back in
01:23:44 so they get whereas most people no most
01:23:46 people have not had the chance to go
01:23:48 viral
01:23:48 or have their 15 seconds of fame online
01:23:51 so they'll give it to you like a little
01:23:52 drug dealer and give you that dopamine
01:23:54 so now you come back and keep trying to
01:23:57 do it again and trying and trying and
01:23:58 trying
01:23:58 right and at work i mean it may or may
01:24:01 not have worked but
01:24:03 that makes sense i mean they're trying
01:24:05 to rope you in the best way to rope you
01:24:07 in is give you some success
01:24:08 right i mean they're not giving you
01:24:10 money but no one you know that
01:24:12 well don't you think that in a way well
01:24:14 i guess it's not really
01:24:16 comparable i was talking about the apple
01:24:18 algorithm they use for podcasts where
01:24:20 the new
01:24:21 it's probably similar a little bit
01:24:23 because the way you first started yeah
01:24:24 they think you'll
01:24:25 just shoot you up to the top so you can
01:24:26 like um we have the most successful
01:24:28 podcast we just started that's that's
01:24:30 amazing yeah let's keep at this thing
01:24:31 yes and then once the algorithm it's a
01:24:33 weird algorithm like it tricks you
01:24:35 because if you have a new podcast what
01:24:37 are the what are the specifics do we
01:24:39 know the specifics
01:24:40 no one knows so it's just guessing
01:24:41 guessing for sure trying things out to
01:24:43 figure out like this actually works
01:24:45 it's funny how people like like apple
01:24:48 and and also
01:24:50 things like netflix like netflix you
01:24:51 never you never have any idea
01:24:54 what's like what's num what the numbers
01:24:56 are what
01:24:57 number of people are viewing things it
01:24:58 doesn't say it like a youtube clip does
01:25:00 you have to kind of guess they they know
01:25:02 but they don't tell anybody
01:25:03 but it's kind of the same thing in a way
01:25:06 yeah i mean
01:25:06 i've seen people say like the nba
01:25:08 ratings are way down right now and it's
01:25:09 well
01:25:11 these are almost pre-season games a lot
01:25:13 of people watch the last two games of
01:25:14 the
01:25:14 regular season anyway with all the games
01:25:17 have been figured out next week when the
01:25:18 playoffs start
01:25:19 then check the ratings and see where
01:25:20 they're at but it's just uh
01:25:23 it's interesting to me when you have no
01:25:25 idea what the algorithm is whether it's
01:25:26 the uh
01:25:27 itunes podcast algorithm or netflix's
01:25:30 algorithm you really don't know you
01:25:31 don't
01:25:32 they know when we were kids we thought
01:25:33 trl was people calling and voting to
01:25:36 make the most popular video on mtv every
01:25:37 day like that was an act that wasn't
01:25:38 happening dude how crazy was rob lowe
01:25:40 saying that he was on the worst
01:25:42 show on television meaning it was the
01:25:43 the least rated show on television and
01:25:45 it was 19 million people watched it
01:25:48 yeah that's because there wasn't any
01:25:50 tick tocks back then
01:25:51 but how bonkers is that yeah and that
01:25:54 was what is that the 80s
01:25:55 yeah yeah i think 19 million now you'd
01:25:59 be for sure the biggest hit on any tv
01:26:01 but we decided
01:26:02 right didn't we look at it i think yeah
01:26:03 we found ncis
01:26:05 is like number one and that has like 15
01:26:07 million crazy
01:26:08 which is sounds like an enormous number
01:26:10 yeah the fact that 19 million
01:26:12 which the was the worst rated show
01:26:15 would be the biggest most highly rated
01:26:17 show now yeah
01:26:19 that's because there's so many different
01:26:20 ways to watch so much
01:26:22 content speaking of content don't you
01:26:24 have a podcast i do have a podcast how
01:26:26 about that segue
01:26:27 thank you professional yeah i have a
01:26:30 podcast called resting bitch
01:26:34 it's perfect that's what it's called but
01:26:36 i made the mistake i didn't know i just
01:26:38 like went into it i'm like i have a
01:26:39 resting bitch face have a resting bitch
01:26:41 voice like and i'm going to be doing it
01:26:42 on a couch and i look like i'm resting
01:26:44 bitch you know
01:26:45 right and oh look at that jimmy you're
01:26:47 so good
01:26:49 he's the best he's the best um so
01:26:52 yeah i have that pot oh remember when i
01:26:54 used to do shows
01:26:55 dan and you practically annie assaulted
01:26:58 me on this episode she tried to eat me
01:27:00 out
01:27:01 i love her me too she's so funny
01:27:05 she's awesome and that they're doing a
01:27:07 comedy story documentary i got to see a
01:27:08 clip of
01:27:09 with her in it i'm nervous i'm supposed
01:27:11 to be in that
01:27:12 we'll see i'm nervous but um yeah i do
01:27:15 that podcast from my producer anthony's
01:27:17 house
01:27:18 and uh yeah it's fun that's awesome yeah
01:27:22 but because it has the word bitch in the
01:27:24 title it doesn't
01:27:25 pop up right away because they try and
01:27:27 like put yeah i made the mistake
01:27:29 whatever next podcast the ali makovsky
01:27:32 experience
01:27:33 so did they do they censor that i don't
01:27:36 think they censor i just think like on
01:27:37 youtube it's not gonna be like
01:27:39 top of the recommended or something
01:27:41 because the word bitch
01:27:42 yeah but also because it's not like it's
01:27:44 the most popping thing but
01:27:46 it's definitely a little bit hidden not
01:27:48 shadow band but
01:27:49 you could just call it resting b yeah
01:27:51 resting b pod
01:27:52 or just call it your fucking name kid
01:27:56 that's the easiest way because if i
01:27:58 think like i like
01:27:59 names of shows that are interesting but
01:28:02 uh
01:28:02 if i want to see the joey diaz show i
01:28:04 want to see the joey diaz show
01:28:05 where's the joey dia show like i don't
01:28:07 care what you call it what is it
01:28:08 yeah joey diaz it's the fucking canoe on
01:28:11 top of the house what
01:28:12 that's the name of my show the canoe on
01:28:14 top of the house is he moving too
01:28:16 he is moving too he's moving to new
01:28:18 jersey
01:28:20 yeah i'll get him going i give him a
01:28:23 year of ice and snow
01:28:25 that's what i said about you really yeah
01:28:27 give me a year yeah we'll see what's up
01:28:29 i don't know i feel are you keeping your
01:28:31 place out here
01:28:33 yeah okay yeah that's good good for now
01:28:36 okay we'll see yeah so it's just vacant
01:28:39 that means like if someone
01:28:40 one of your friends who's like 24. i got
01:28:43 people
01:28:44 okay this is a weird state right now it
01:28:47 is weird i don't know what to do i keep
01:28:49 debating i'm like do i move in with my
01:28:50 parents
01:28:51 do i stay at my place well it's not it's
01:28:54 never a bad thing to be with other folks
01:28:56 especially if you don't mind it and you
01:28:58 actually enjoy being around them because
01:29:00 this is like a fucking strange time
01:29:01 people need help
01:29:02 sometimes people are sick and they don't
01:29:04 want to admit it and you got to go hey
01:29:06 let me are you okay and you got to
01:29:07 fucking get into the hospital as quick
01:29:08 as you can
01:29:10 you know wait what do you mean old
01:29:11 people that get coronavirus
01:29:13 yeah are you saying my parents anybody
01:29:16 not just you but anybody like living
01:29:18 with your parents not a bad move
01:29:19 yeah but the problem is you have to be
01:29:22 really responsible with what you do
01:29:24 there's a lot of kids that want to live
01:29:25 with their parents and then they want to
01:29:26 go party
01:29:27 like you could kill your parents like
01:29:29 that shit is happening to people there
01:29:31 was a
01:29:31 21 year old kid who came home gave it to
01:29:34 his dad his dad was in the fucking icu
01:29:36 that i would feel so guilty didn't know
01:29:39 probably didn't even know he had it i
01:29:41 had a friend i was with who tested
01:29:42 positive and i'm like that sucks because
01:29:44 then you have to
01:29:45 act like you have an std or something
01:29:47 and text everyone hey we had a really
01:29:48 good time last week but i have some bad
01:29:50 news
01:29:51 you got to get tested yeah people have
01:29:54 done that at parties they're having
01:29:55 these um
01:29:56 influencer parties and you know they
01:29:59 just go buck wild no masks
01:30:00 start drinking yeah there was a video
01:30:02 like apparently they have houses
01:30:04 this is a thing like influencers get
01:30:06 houses and then they do parties and that
01:30:08 jamie's laughing
01:30:09 because it's like i'm learning about
01:30:10 fire so you hit sticks
01:30:12 you rub them you make fire it's warmer
01:30:16 i joked about the high pass this weekend
01:30:18 i was totally making a joke and she's
01:30:19 like yeah
01:30:19 that's where they live i was like oh i
01:30:22 don't even know why i know that that's a
01:30:23 thing but
01:30:24 it's a thing so they do it there's a
01:30:25 bunch of people doing that now they get
01:30:27 houses
01:30:28 yeah and then they go crazy my sister
01:30:30 just had her bachelorette party
01:30:32 but everyone got tested before we stayed
01:30:36 in the airbnb the whole time
01:30:37 [Music]
01:30:38 um so i think there's ways of doing it
01:30:41 that are okay
01:30:42 yeah there's ways of doing it that are
01:30:44 okay
01:30:46 but you can't be drinking and fucking
01:30:48 jumping on top of each other in the pool
01:30:50 yeah and you know there's a hundred and
01:30:52 ninety thousand of you
01:30:53 i mean they've had these they're having
01:30:55 these fucking parties with like 200
01:30:56 people jammed into a house and
01:30:57 everybody's breathing each other's air
01:30:59 where's my invite charlie demelio kovid
01:31:02 parties are a pandemic urban legend that
01:31:04 won't go away
01:31:05 oh but that's what people trying to
01:31:06 catch right that's yeah just so there's
01:31:08 a clarification on that that people
01:31:09 don't think
01:31:10 well that's that's a different thing
01:31:11 what we're talking about is uh
01:31:13 influencer parties where they just
01:31:14 they don't give a fuck about the rules
01:31:16 leonardo dicaprio
01:31:17 had a party on his yacht and everyone
01:31:19 was wearing cowboy hats and i'm pretty
01:31:21 sure he stole
01:31:22 my coveted cowboy theme at least i'm
01:31:25 going to say that
01:31:26 that sounds very schizophrenic and
01:31:28 probably don't mention that in public
01:31:30 no leo's watching he's aware of what i'm
01:31:32 talking about
01:31:33 these um coveted parties where people
01:31:35 are trying to catch covet that's
01:31:36 bullshit though right
01:31:38 yeah but these aren't remember i was
01:31:39 telling you they're saying there's like
01:31:41 these giant la
01:31:42 hollywood hills mansion party they're
01:31:43 gonna start shutting down they were like
01:31:45 these were on
01:31:46 tv they had like uh the
01:31:49 cameras that are usually doing the
01:31:50 high-speed chases they were like
01:31:51 watching these well
01:31:52 my um yeah that that that thing is weird
01:31:55 because
01:31:56 the gut the mayor rather is gonna shut
01:31:58 down the power and shut off
01:32:00 uh the water to these people right
01:32:02 there's a certain amount of houses that
01:32:03 think that no one lives in they're just
01:32:04 normally rented out for
01:32:05 houses for parties in general and
01:32:07 they're probably people were just like
01:32:08 oh
01:32:09 that was like what bilzerian was doing
01:32:11 right something like that
01:32:13 yeah he rented this big giant ass house
01:32:15 in bel air and he'd have these big
01:32:17 crazy influencer parties people get real
01:32:19 mad yeah
01:32:20 that like if you if you live in these
01:32:22 neighborhoods and you're like a regular
01:32:23 person with like a regular life
01:32:25 and then all of a sudden an influencer
01:32:26 party moves in next door nightmare
01:32:28 all day long they're just blasting music
01:32:31 and fucking smoking weed and you're like
01:32:32 oh
01:32:33 no yeah well i remember jake and logan
01:32:36 paul
01:32:36 used to have a house right by the improv
01:32:38 yes
01:32:39 and kids would just show up at their
01:32:41 house there would be like it looked like
01:32:42 a block party there were all these
01:32:44 teenage girls
01:32:45 yelling out their window and all the
01:32:46 neighbors were like we're just trying to
01:32:48 live
01:32:48 yeah they if they fucked up and now that
01:32:50 one one of the brothers jake or logan
01:32:53 got raided his house got raided i think
01:32:55 that was jake there were guns everywhere
01:32:57 yeah well he was the guy that was at the
01:32:59 arizona
01:33:00 mall yeah looting yeah
01:33:04 whoops why people looting is very
01:33:06 interesting
01:33:08 it's not good
01:33:09 [Laughter]
01:33:12 yeah it's weird watching people just
01:33:13 steal shit and run out of stores
01:33:15 like wow this is so weird it's just
01:33:17 weird watching
01:33:18 yeah it feels very like a apocalyptic
01:33:21 movie
01:33:22 it does yeah well it's coming it comes
01:33:24 out in these like big bursts too
01:33:27 like what happened in chicago these big
01:33:29 bursts of looting and you're watching on
01:33:30 television you're like
01:33:31 this is such a crazy virus that's in the
01:33:34 air but it's indicative of all these
01:33:35 people needing things and
01:33:37 being broke as fuck man like not having
01:33:39 any work at all for months and months
01:33:41 and months and watch the economy crumble
01:33:42 with no
01:33:43 like you would steal too i think we
01:33:45 would all steal if we were 20 years old
01:33:47 and fucked up and
01:33:48 you're that that's where you live and
01:33:50 everybody else is stealing like let's do
01:33:51 it let's fucking do it you run in that
01:33:53 store
01:33:54 you know there's a thing that happens to
01:33:57 people
01:33:58 when there's a bunch of us and things go
01:34:00 sideways
01:34:01 like chaos big chaos moments well
01:34:03 there's always chaos but it's like
01:34:05 somewhat controlled you know
01:34:07 the chaos is organized in a way where
01:34:08 you feel like there's no chaos and
01:34:10 things are
01:34:11 smooth and i think this just kind of
01:34:13 cracked it open where it's like oh we
01:34:14 can just kind of
01:34:15 do whatever well it's the thin
01:34:18 veneer of civilization has been exposed
01:34:22 there's some cracks and you see
01:34:23 right through it and you saw through it
01:34:25 during the looting in santa monica
01:34:27 i was watching this guy run around with
01:34:28 a gun and he's pointing it at people
01:34:30 and this other guy was yelling at him
01:34:31 and he's sticking the gun at him and
01:34:32 then he runs into traffic and people are
01:34:34 honking this guy's got a gun
01:34:35 and there's just people running out of
01:34:36 stores stealing shit and i remember
01:34:38 watching that video going whoa
01:34:41 this is santa monica yeah like this is
01:34:43 wild
01:34:44 yeah this is uh if there was a movie and
01:34:47 in the movie a disease spread that made
01:34:50 people
01:34:50 reckless and wild and it made them
01:34:54 they started stealing and assaulting
01:34:55 each other and carrying guns everywhere
01:34:56 it was just a disease that flew through
01:34:58 the air yeah you'd be like what a crazy
01:35:00 movie like this is santa monica 2020
01:35:02 like
01:35:03 fuck you ah santa monica it
01:35:06 was like like someone had sprayed
01:35:09 something in the air that made people
01:35:11 hyper aggressive and reckless and crazy
01:35:13 that's what it seemed like because you
01:35:14 go into like that fight or flight mode
01:35:16 you're like i don't know what's gonna
01:35:17 happen
01:35:17 i don't know where i fit into this
01:35:19 equation there's that but i think
01:35:21 there's also something else going on
01:35:22 when they when they say that term mob
01:35:24 mentality yeah have you ever felt it
01:35:27 for sure have you ever been in a place
01:35:28 where like a fight breaks out at a
01:35:30 basketball game or something like that
01:35:32 or there's anybody anywhere there's a
01:35:33 large group of people
01:35:34 and a fight breaks out there's a
01:35:36 crackling in the air
01:35:38 like you're ready to stab somebody yeah
01:35:40 like it's nuts that's how i felt at the
01:35:41 ufc
01:35:42 i was like i'm taking jiu jitsu right
01:35:43 now sign me up
01:35:46 that's a little different but i'm
01:35:47 talking about like lawless shit
01:35:49 yeah the the violence that you see at
01:35:50 the ufc is the best substitute because
01:35:52 it's completely controlled
01:35:54 everybody has a hold of it you know
01:35:55 there's rules there's a referee there's
01:35:57 doctors it's trained fighters
01:35:58 so many rules yes it's really very it's
01:36:01 very well set up and very important but
01:36:03 the thing about it is that is violence
01:36:06 but it's just violence in the most
01:36:08 controlled and safe way
01:36:10 yeah what i'm talking about is lawless
01:36:11 violence when shit breaks out
01:36:13 like a scrap in a parking lot when
01:36:15 people are fighting
01:36:16 that's when things are strange because
01:36:18 that's that feeling like fucking
01:36:20 anything can happen someone could shoot
01:36:21 somebody somebody could run people over
01:36:23 people generally never run people over
01:36:25 on purpose but they do when they're
01:36:27 yelling at each other like if you're at
01:36:28 a gas station you see someone fucking
01:36:30 run someone over on a youtube video
01:36:32 you're like oh my god like what is
01:36:34 happening yeah
01:36:35 they're going sideways conflict makes me
01:36:37 so anxious i hate
01:36:39 seeing like fights or any like it just
01:36:42 makes me sweat
01:36:43 yeah well like visual altercation
01:36:45 stresses me out
01:36:46 i was uh at a it turned into a riot
01:36:50 where seven or eight i think 13 cars got
01:36:52 flipped over
01:36:53 after ohio state beat michigan one year
01:36:55 and we were headed to the national
01:36:56 championship
01:36:57 and you could feel around four o'clock
01:36:59 when one couch was on fire in the middle
01:37:01 of the street that like
01:37:03 we're in the hornet's nest like this
01:37:04 shit's about to go down later and it
01:37:05 definitely did
01:37:07 i remember seeing the swat team get up
01:37:08 at the end of the street knee knocker
01:37:09 bullets getting blasted out tear gas
01:37:11 almost like what's been going on
01:37:12 now it's just like 18 years ago but damn
01:37:15 as
01:37:16 you were sort of saying i was like
01:37:17 actually that one time
01:37:19 after the connor and khabib fight i was
01:37:21 in the crowd right where that was
01:37:22 happening
01:37:24 for about three minutes it felt crazy
01:37:26 and then like they kind of got a hold of
01:37:27 everything and they were like it's fine
01:37:29 but like
01:37:30 i thought it would have been there for a
01:37:31 second that could have been crazy yeah
01:37:32 it could have been really crazy
01:37:34 that was one of those moments where you
01:37:36 know those lawless melee moments
01:37:39 that was pretty controllable there was a
01:37:41 bunch of amazing i didn't i wasn't that
01:37:42 there's a police around or whatever but
01:37:44 just for that little spot because i was
01:37:45 like i was right there and there's some
01:37:46 drunk guy next to me that was the thing
01:37:47 about
01:37:48 that one though it was so entertaining
01:37:51 because it was two of the best fighters
01:37:52 in the world involved in
01:37:54 post-fight brawls right so conor's
01:37:58 getting beat up by these dudes jumping
01:37:59 over the cage chaos excitement into just
01:38:01 like hey we got
01:38:02 overtime but no but that's what i think
01:38:04 kept people from fighting in the crowd
01:38:06 like what they were seeing was so
01:38:07 entertaining like you don't get in a
01:38:09 fight in the middle of a great fight
01:38:10 yeah you get in the fight
01:38:11 when you know something happens and then
01:38:13 you decide it was just weird i just
01:38:15 it was weird i was from i'm trying i was
01:38:16 putting myself back in the feeling of
01:38:18 like hold on the fight's over
01:38:19 and now what's going on around me this
01:38:21 is crazy oh shit that's the only time i
01:38:23 felt that again it was just like i
01:38:24 cuz when the cars were getting flipped
01:38:26 me and my friends we were not we knew
01:38:27 better than to get in it like
01:38:29 right doesn't it feel like something
01:38:31 changes in the air oh yeah
01:38:33 yeah plus you could smell the tear gas
01:38:35 that day but yeah
01:38:37 yeah but there's something about like
01:38:39 chaos
01:38:40 where i think it's because of war i
01:38:42 think
01:38:43 every human being that's alive today is
01:38:45 the descendant of people who are
01:38:46 successful in war
01:38:48 it just seems like war has always been
01:38:49 around right and ever since
01:38:51 the first you know really
01:38:54 uh primitive primates hit each other
01:38:57 with rocks and figured out that it's a
01:38:58 better way to do it than just biting
01:38:59 each other
01:39:00 you know the first the first animal that
01:39:02 figured out how to
01:39:04 start you know attacking other groups
01:39:06 and
01:39:07 dominate them and gain success and gain
01:39:09 their food and gain their women they
01:39:10 just been doing that ever since yeah
01:39:12 so we are the people that survive that i
01:39:14 think there's a switch
01:39:15 that goes off when there's like a riot
01:39:17 with some chaos yeah
01:39:18 like you got to be re like any fucking
01:39:20 thing can happen right now
01:39:22 and people do shit they would never do
01:39:24 yeah like something about it's like a
01:39:25 melee
01:39:26 button that gets hit like
01:39:29 you felt it right yeah shit's scary
01:39:32 then this is what we're seeing as a
01:39:33 country like the whole country hit this
01:39:35 melee button
01:39:36 and that's where the looting and the
01:39:38 like people are way more aggressive with
01:39:39 it i mean i'm watching people drive
01:39:41 different
01:39:41 people just running red lights broke
01:39:43 people run red lights sometimes like
01:39:45 fucking five months
01:39:46 yeah they just they just they don't want
01:39:48 to stop
01:39:50 they they're they're cutting people off
01:39:52 and watch this lady just
01:39:54 pull out of this covid test place and
01:39:55 clip some lady's car like
01:39:57 she was like frantic like it does feel
01:39:59 like people are more on edge now
01:40:01 100 i think it's yeah i think like
01:40:03 people being inside and this kind of
01:40:05 like unknown
01:40:06 feeling is really causing people to go
01:40:08 through like a lot of mental
01:40:09 anguish well and then we go back to the
01:40:11 financial shit yeah
01:40:13 like they're like how do i get out of
01:40:14 this yeah how do i get out of this
01:40:16 yeah like if it's already five months in
01:40:20 and i know this is to go on until

01:43:36 other and stab each other with the
01:43:37 weapons that nature has
01:43:39 bestowed upon them they grow them out
01:43:41 every year and then they fall off
01:43:44 so that that would fall off
01:43:47 and then new ones would grow in a couple
01:43:49 of months yes that's real
01:43:51 damn yeah it's the king of the mountain
01:43:54 crazy there's a there's i don't think
01:43:56 it's on that same page
01:43:57 i wish i could find the page it was on
01:43:59 because i forgot to bookmark it but
01:44:01 there was a crazy video of this elk
01:44:03 running away from this pack of wolves
01:44:05 and this pack wolves is just snapping at
01:44:07 its
01:44:08 legs and just running up behind it and
01:44:10 chasing it snapping at its legs
01:44:12 and then they eventually just swarm it
01:44:14 it's it is
01:44:15 ruthless yeah it is so wild to see
01:44:19 that these these just
01:44:22 giant ancestors of dogs exist
01:44:26 free in the mountains it's really
01:44:28 fucking pretty amazing yeah
01:44:30 so in north america wolves taking out a
01:44:34 giant elk and you could watch the video
01:44:36 i mean i don't know if they did it from
01:44:37 a drone or what because it was up in the
01:44:39 sky and it's
01:44:41 it's it's so ruthless is this one
01:44:45 this is this is where the wolves are
01:44:46 chasing them
01:44:48 but when they get one okay here yeah and
01:44:50 they can run really good in the snow
01:44:52 because their feet
01:44:53 are like uh at the the end of them are
01:44:55 webbed almost like a snowshoe
01:44:57 they have really enormous feet whereas
01:44:59 the elk kind of sink in the snow and it
01:45:01 hinders their movement
01:45:04 let me imagine that has been playing out
01:45:07 that that war
01:45:08 between wolves and elk that's been
01:45:10 playing out for
01:45:11 thousands and thousands of years when
01:45:13 did you get into like all the hunting
01:45:15 and
01:45:16 stuff like that look at how they bite
01:45:18 them on the legs this is how they go
01:45:20 after them they bite them on the legs
01:45:24 yeah this is the video this is it so
01:45:26 this is where i i saw it on instagram
01:45:28 the elk i'm not showing it on screen
01:45:30 because you can't yeah the elk is
01:45:32 sorry the elk is running and the wolf
01:45:34 pack is behind it
01:45:35 and you can see he keeps going deeper
01:45:37 and deeper into the snow and he's
01:45:38 stumbling
01:45:40 and the wolves just eventually get him
01:45:41 and when they get him it's ruthless
01:45:43 we don't have to watch it wolf pack
01:45:45 gives chase to a group of elk
01:45:47 if you want to look that up yeah there
01:45:48 you go there's another one grizzly bear
01:45:50 chases elk in yellowstone park
01:45:52 somebody posted a one yesterday i wish i
01:45:55 saw it i wish i bookmarked that one too
01:45:57 but it was a bison hitting another bison
01:45:59 and
01:45:59 making it fly through the air it's crazy
01:46:03 so these people are in the road right
01:46:04 and they're watching these bison walk
01:46:06 across the road and the bison
01:46:08 started fucking with each other and one
01:46:09 of them gets mad and runs at the other
01:46:11 one and launches him into the air
01:46:13 so you're looking at a 2 000 plus pound
01:46:15 animal and this other
01:46:16 2 000 plus pound animal throws it
01:46:18 through the air with its head
01:46:20 just makes it go flying have you ever

01:47:26 but if the opportunity presents itself
01:47:28 so it didn't become an obsession but you
01:47:30 and you were entertained
01:47:32 yeah there were certain guns that i
01:47:33 liked shooting more than others that
01:47:35 were more fun
01:47:36 it's a smart thing to learn how to do
01:47:38 yeah unfortunately when you see
01:47:40 the santa monica scene you see the thin
01:47:42 veneer of civilization
01:47:44 pulled off and how easily people can go
01:47:46 crazy
01:47:48 it's a bummer but it's real yeah
01:47:52 yeah i just hope it all gets better me
01:47:54 too
01:47:55 i feel like everyone's so negative are
01:47:57 you uh
01:47:58 eagerly anticipating what's gonna happen
01:48:00 during the election
01:48:03 are you weirded out by like the
01:48:04 possibility that no matter who wins it
01:48:06 could be chaos
01:48:07 uh yeah i think like what you were
01:48:08 saying it's like it's already
01:48:10 you know we already kind of see through
01:48:11 the government and realize it's all
01:48:13 pretty fucked regardless of whoever wins
01:48:16 no matter how good the candidate is but
01:48:17 i also think that this has shown us like
01:48:20 we do have so much power to influence
01:48:22 what happens it's
01:48:23 not so much who the figure is or the
01:48:25 person wearing the suit it's more about
01:48:27 like people coming together
01:48:29 and like making some change themselves
01:48:32 you sound like a person who bought in
01:48:34 all the political propaganda that
01:48:35 they're pumping out in the news right
01:48:36 now
01:48:37 this it's really about big businesses
01:48:39 and special interests
01:48:40 making as much money as possible and
01:48:42 keeping people fat and stupid
01:48:43 and they do their best to keep us
01:48:45 uneducated trapped inside our house with
01:48:47 low vitamin d
01:48:49 and then they create viruses and then
01:48:50 they release those viruses
01:48:52 purpose no i don't think that i know i
01:48:55 know i know
01:48:56 but only fucking around if you didn't
01:48:57 get it people at home
01:48:59 yeah i don't know i just i think that we
01:49:01 do i think we're just realizing that we
01:49:03 do have more power to influence how
01:49:05 things go
01:49:06 sure we do yeah we have more of a voice
01:49:08 for sure
01:49:09 than ever before it's it's very
01:49:11 interesting i just want people
01:49:13 hopefully to use their voice in like a
01:49:15 positive way i think that it's really
01:49:17 easy to like attack people
01:49:20 regardless of whether it's political or
01:49:21 not nowadays with anything going on it's
01:49:24 so easy to be like a negative voice
01:49:26 when i think well it feels you feel
01:49:28 angry
01:49:29 you know the anger that most people have
01:49:31 is uh accentuated by
01:49:33 the economic situation and the virus
01:49:35 situation right so
01:49:37 even if you are already like a angry
01:49:39 person
01:49:40 you're going to be really angry now and
01:49:42 frustrated and it doesn't seem like a
01:49:43 way out
01:49:45 i almost like the way people are the the
01:49:47 way people are behaving today
01:49:50 with all the tension and all the
01:49:51 infighting and all the chaos
01:49:53 it's almost like this isn't
01:49:57 it's not even their fault i i really
01:49:59 almost feel that way i feel like
01:50:01 most people are so unprepared for
01:50:03 something this stressful and anything
01:50:04 that's really stressful like that gets
01:50:06 you so out of your head
01:50:07 and when everybody's out of their head
01:50:08 and no one can just calm down
01:50:10 it's not a good combination it's not
01:50:13 good for anybody and
01:50:14 the real problem is there's not a real
01:50:16 clear
01:50:18 antidote for it yeah there's not a real
01:50:20 clear path out of this that's what makes
01:50:22 me real nervous
01:50:23 that's why i know it sounds so
01:50:25 miscongeniality but i think like if
01:50:27 people were just like nicer to each
01:50:29 other
01:50:29 yeah it sounds so corny but not all the
01:50:32 time it doesn't need to be like
01:50:33 phony niceness but rather than being
01:50:36 like mean or negative or attacking just
01:50:38 don't
01:50:38 say mean i don't know i just
01:50:42 people have requirements and one of the
01:50:44 requirements is they have to be able to
01:50:45 make a living
01:50:46 yeah you know and i as much as i think
01:50:48 that uh
01:50:49 universal basic income like one of the
01:50:50 things this whole
01:50:52 pandemic shit what it's shown us that
01:50:55 it's not a bad idea to have a certain
01:50:57 amount of money that you have allocated
01:50:58 to everybody so that they could pay
01:50:59 their bills and pay for food it seems
01:51:01 like we should figure that out and
01:51:04 andrew yang was talking about this in
01:51:05 terms of automation but
01:51:07 it's just as important with or more
01:51:09 important with this yeah with the
01:51:11 pandemic because you don't have any
01:51:12 choices everybody has i mean it's like
01:51:14 if automation comes and takes your job
01:51:16 maybe you can figure out another job
01:51:17 yeah but if there's no fucking jobs
01:51:19 because no one's allowed to work
01:51:21 then that's the best argument ever for
01:51:24 universal basic income
01:51:25 because yeah you can't do anything it's
01:51:27 not your fault yeah
01:51:28 i feel like only fans is like the new
01:51:31 trading of first it's like here's nudes
01:51:34 can i make money do you
01:51:36 that is such a great joke you shouldn't
01:51:38 have said that on the podcast you just
01:51:40 saved that one
01:51:41 okay i'm putting it in the bank yeah we
01:51:43 have to fucking delete that
01:51:44 no keep it in it's funny it's very funny
01:51:47 people yeah it's very funny i need any
01:51:49 funny moment
01:51:51 leave it the way it is and then uh just
01:51:54 expand upon it as a bit because
01:51:56 you're totally right it is like the new
01:51:57 training because i was thinking i'm like
01:51:59 okay well if comedy's dead and there's
01:52:02 like i can either
01:52:03 sell chicken wings but like i don't know
01:52:05 there's only so many i want to go back
01:52:06 to trading but there's only so much you
01:52:08 can trade and like the only thing i have
01:52:09 is my feet
01:52:10 during time during times of great
01:52:14 prosperity
01:52:15 being a hoe is a choice yeah right but
01:52:18 there's a lot of reluctant hoes
01:52:19 i'm i'm i'm a scared hoe on the inside
01:52:22 i'm like i'm a bad bitch i listen to meg
01:52:24 the stallion cardi b
01:52:25 wet ass puss he's my anthem and then
01:52:27 like i'll talk to a guy on a dating app
01:52:29 and i'm like
01:52:30 uh do you want to go to the park and
01:52:32 like i don't know
01:52:33 what do you want to do even though you
01:52:36 enjoy those art forms and people's
01:52:37 expression
01:52:38 in general you're a pretty calm person
01:52:40 yeah that's why
01:52:41 yeah you like that music because it's
01:52:43 fun but that's not that doesn't define
01:52:45 you
01:52:45 no how funny was that ben shapiro thing
01:52:48 oh my
01:52:49 god the wet ass pussy thing my god
01:52:51 that's a result of a gynecological
01:52:53 situation yeah
01:52:54 how did he say it i don't even know he
01:52:56 like was reading them and he's like well
01:52:58 in conclusion
01:52:59 what else pussy is actually not that wet
01:53:01 uh
01:53:03 um ben benny stay in your lane
01:53:06 benny boy oh my god
01:53:09 i mean i like ben shapiro let me just
01:53:11 state this i think
01:53:12 uh people get the wrong impression about
01:53:15 him all the time i think he's a very
01:53:16 nice guy he's a very smart guy
01:53:18 but he uh he has his blind spots like we
01:53:21 all do
01:53:22 and when you think that wet ass pussy is
01:53:26 a gynecological condition
01:53:29 whoops let me tell you something
01:53:32 [Laughter]
01:53:34 the mass humiliation of ben shapiro i
01:53:36 don't like him
01:53:38 he scares me i like him as a human i
01:53:40 know him as a human being
01:53:41 and that's a problem like you see
01:53:43 someone who does like performative work
01:53:46 about politics because part of what he
01:53:47 does is funny like he has
01:53:49 a mug that says leftist tears
01:53:52 you know and when he serves you water
01:53:54 like when ezra klein from vox was on his
01:53:57 show
01:53:57 he drank out of a cup that said leftist
01:53:59 tears yeah
01:54:00 and they were actually talking about it
01:54:02 like he's like like don't you think this
01:54:03 is
01:54:04 like i think it's funny yeah he leans
01:54:06 into it
01:54:07 look he's good guys just not perfect not
01:54:09 like all of us that's the thing like
01:54:11 you want to find one thing wrong with
01:54:12 the person and fucking hate him yeah and
01:54:14 that's
01:54:15 just silly yeah you can still think he's
01:54:17 a nice guy and still think it's fucking
01:54:18 silly to make fun of wet pussy totally
01:54:21 or it's like i might not like the guy
01:54:23 but i don't need to like
01:54:25 attack him yeah i'm telling you but he
01:54:27 does have a goofy ass
01:54:28 little smirk well he's he's a
01:54:31 professional look
01:54:32 one of the reasons why people love floyd
01:54:34 mayweather is because he talks
01:54:37 so much shit he talks so much he's
01:54:39 always showing his money
01:54:40 he's kind of trolling in a way that's
01:54:42 become such a thing
01:54:43 in fighting and then well with him he
01:54:45 was so good at it because
01:54:48 he was a guy who was uh very safety
01:54:50 first as a boxer like
01:54:51 incredibly skillful like arguably the
01:54:53 best boxer of all time
01:54:55 but he he didn't go after guys
01:54:59 and just engage in wars he fought very
01:55:01 tactically and
01:55:02 he's fighting the best fighters in the
01:55:04 world so he has to fight
01:55:06 very cautiously sometimes that's the
01:55:07 correct way to do it
01:55:09 but he figured out a way to get people
01:55:11 to pay attention because
01:55:13 that generally like being the most
01:55:15 skillful is great
01:55:17 but you want people to pay attention so
01:55:18 you want to be like a mike tyson guy who
01:55:20 knocks everybody out
01:55:21 well if you're not a mike tyson guy that
01:55:22 knocks everybody out the best way to get
01:55:24 people to pay attention is
01:55:25 make them want you to lose show them all
01:55:28 your money oh look at that watch it's a
01:55:30 million dollars
01:55:30 yeah look at this hat look at these
01:55:31 diamonds look at this and look at this
01:55:33 jet i just flew in a bitch and get shit
01:55:34 yeah no and you just want to beat him up
01:55:37 you want him to get his ass kicked but
01:55:38 meanwhile he's the best boxer ever and
01:55:40 so he's just out boxing all these people
01:55:42 and he never gets his ass kicked
01:55:43 it's kind of funny i mean if you really
01:55:46 pay attention to it it's kind of fun
01:55:47 well ben shapiro is
01:55:49 that's kind of what he does like says
01:55:50 things knowing it's going to piss people
01:55:52 off and then they're paying attention to
01:55:54 him yeah
01:55:54 but he also says some things that make
01:55:56 sense he's very good at debate he's very
01:55:58 good at uh
01:56:00 arguing with uh uneducated
01:56:03 people who just like automatically
01:56:06 subscribe to left-wing ideas he can chop
01:56:08 those up quick if you don't have your
01:56:10 your thoughts dialed in and your
01:56:11 argument dialed in
01:56:13 but he's you know he's a person yeah
01:56:15 he's a very nice guy
01:56:16 we're all people just people why can't
01:56:18 we all just get along because we're
01:56:20 scared i know this is the this is the if
01:56:23 i can
01:56:23 you know people oh it's fucking easy for
01:56:25 you guys you're fucking making money
01:56:26 you're a comedian you're this
01:56:28 [Music]
01:56:29 you're right but when ali is saying
01:56:33 if we just be nicer to each other is the
01:56:36 solution
01:56:37 i think it is if there's more
01:56:38 camaraderie and understanding and seeing
01:56:40 that people like ben
01:56:42 or alex jones all your fun friends you
01:56:44 know
01:56:45 they're all people yeah they're human
01:56:47 beings you know i don't yeah this is the
01:56:48 thing that's like
01:56:49 this is the one of the real problems
01:56:51 with cancer culture like they'll say
01:56:52 something like uh
01:56:53 like oh matt lauer's got plenty of money
01:56:57 you know or and make up a person who's
01:56:59 been canceled oh they're fine they got
01:57:00 plenty of money
01:57:02 it's you're not thinking about what what
01:57:04 hurts
01:57:05 yeah it's material yeah what hurts is
01:57:07 the psychological aspect of
01:57:09 whatever it is and what we're doing
01:57:13 is we're lash we're lashing out at
01:57:16 people
01:57:16 for mistakes and we're saying it in a
01:57:19 way where like there's no way you can
01:57:21 get better
01:57:21 and this is who you are forever yeah and
01:57:24 there's like a narrative that people
01:57:25 create they assume that they know things
01:57:27 about you and
01:57:28 want to create this story to make it
01:57:30 look a certain way to validate their
01:57:32 point when it's like
01:57:33 no one knows anyone entirely like you
01:57:35 have kids you don't know exactly who
01:57:37 they are because they're their own
01:57:38 little
01:57:39 thing you know exactly and as much as
01:57:41 you think you know
01:57:42 you know something about someone like
01:57:44 you just don't and i feel like everyone
01:57:46 should be worthy of redemption and
01:57:49 again we're talking we're not talking
01:57:50 about crimes i'm not talking about
01:57:52 people stealing or murder or rape or
01:57:54 or chaos or stabbing or shooting or not
01:57:57 talking about that
01:57:59 what we're talking about is public
01:58:01 execution yeah there's there's a thing
01:58:03 that people are doing now where they
01:58:05 just love the pile on and it's because
01:58:06 there's
01:58:07 they're not in a good place like there's
01:58:09 so much
01:58:10 negativity i was watching this one pile
01:58:13 on
01:58:14 where this guy was oh this is from
01:58:16 douglas murray's book that's what it was
01:58:17 douglas murray's book um the madness of
01:58:20 crowds
01:58:21 he's a brilliant man an author who is
01:58:23 often
01:58:25 misrepresented they often misrepresent
01:58:27 his positions on things because he
01:58:29 takes a pragmatic non-woke but
01:58:32 he's a gay man gay man from england
01:58:34 who's brilliant and so it's like it's
01:58:36 hard
01:58:36 like they get real confused they run
01:58:38 into him they're like shit
01:58:40 yeah but being gay or having something
01:58:42 like that makes you stand out doesn't
01:58:43 make you uh
01:58:44 well they have a problem like if he has
01:58:46 opinions on trans people or if he has
01:58:48 opinions on
01:58:49 even on gay people even on like his his
01:58:52 opinions of
01:58:53 he thinks what he thinks and he's smart
01:58:55 enough to be able to express it in a way
01:58:56 that's
01:58:57 very difficult to argue yeah and because
01:59:00 of that
01:59:01 people uh they get pissy about it i
01:59:03 remember what i was talking about like
01:59:04 what was the initial point
01:59:06 uh public execution that was before that
01:59:10 people being uh shit fuck
01:59:13 i had a point did you take your own what
01:59:16 were you talking about right before that
01:59:17 though um just about
01:59:19 fuck people deserving second chances and
01:59:22 redemption
01:59:23 and that were all material things like
01:59:27 you can take away someone's money or
01:59:28 whatever
01:59:29 they have enough money they should be
01:59:30 fine i don't know i have a terrible

02:01:21 but if he wasn't there i would have
02:01:22 eaten shit looks like you're about to i
02:01:24 was about to for sure
02:01:26 what happened there that was just me
02:01:28 posted up
02:01:29 cross-eyed thought you were injured no
02:01:32 so why did you decide that was the thing
02:01:36 so okay so i got back to my house at a
02:01:39 room that was open
02:01:40 to rent one of my roommates left and uh
02:01:42 and my friend was like i have a buddy
02:01:44 who's looking for a place so this guy
02:01:45 comes to my house
02:01:46 checks out the room my roommates are
02:01:48 asking him questions like what do you do
02:01:50 for work and he's like oh like skate
02:01:51 stuff whatever he was very vague
02:01:53 and when he was walking out to leave i
02:01:56 saw my skateboard i've had this board
02:01:57 for like four or five years i got it
02:01:59 from supreme i like the deck i thought
02:02:01 that i was going
02:02:02 to be like a skater i thought that
02:02:03 everyone would fall in love with me no
02:02:05 one did so i stopped skating
02:02:07 and so i've had it just sitting in my
02:02:09 front yard for like four or five years
02:02:11 and so he's leaving and i see my board
02:02:13 and i'm like can i resell this like is
02:02:15 there any value or do i just like
02:02:17 give it to a kid like what do i do with
02:02:19 this whole board and he picks it up and
02:02:21 he looks at the deck and he's like this
02:02:22 is my pro model board
02:02:25 like yeah and so then ever since then
02:02:28 we've been skating together his name is
02:02:30 donovan piscopo he's so
02:02:32 tight he's so nice he's so tight yeah
02:02:34 he's so tight
02:02:35 he's so sick he fucking shreds he's so
02:02:38 dope i remember the story
02:02:39 this is a story this really progressive
02:02:41 left-wing person
02:02:42 here we go was tweeting something this
02:02:44 tweet storm of like
02:02:46 you know why does everyone have to be
02:02:48 sexist and racist and
02:02:49 like he adds all these like super woke
02:02:51 things and they said and just sitting
02:02:53 around eating fucking fast food and
02:02:55 watching netflix
02:02:56 that's what made a mistake because then
02:02:58 he was fat shaming and he didn't realize
02:02:59 he was fat-shaming when he said that and
02:03:00 so the people started attacking him like
02:03:02 he said everything in the most
02:03:03 woke way possible wait what it is this
02:03:05 is in douglas murray's book madness of
02:03:06 crowds
02:03:07 and then he goes on this twitter apology
02:03:10 stream that i think murray said it
02:03:12 lasted 15 tweets
02:03:14 he's literally begging for his career
02:03:16 not to be ended
02:03:17 whoa for saying that people ate junk
02:03:20 food
02:03:20 yeah like garbage and like why does
02:03:22 everybody have to do all these things
02:03:24 that are
02:03:24 awful plus get fat and like why are we
02:03:26 lazy why are we stupid
02:03:28 basically that's what he's saying but he
02:03:30 fucked up
02:03:31 and by saying like sitting around eating
02:03:33 garbage food
02:03:34 you're fat shaming you don't even
02:03:36 realize you're you're being hateful
02:03:38 and you can't there's there's no room
02:03:41 there's no room yeah there's no room for
02:03:43 fucking around like you can't
02:03:45 if if you want to be a woke person like
02:03:47 you could get on
02:03:48 you can get canceled at any moment
02:03:50 because yeah you never know when the
02:03:51 standards have shifted
02:03:53 they've become more and more radicalized
02:03:55 and so someone saying something that
02:03:56 like
02:03:56 five six years ago would be like
02:03:58 completely reasonable and make a lot of
02:03:59 sense
02:04:00 the fuck up was talking about people who
02:04:03 are fat like you can't do it
02:04:05 yeah yeah i think well and you can't
02:04:07 explain yourself there's no room to
02:04:09 explain what you mean
02:04:11 or your side you know no one wants to
02:04:13 hear it people just want to be like
02:04:14 you're wrong
02:04:15 and you're bad you're it it's a game
02:04:18 yeah
02:04:19 there's no room for nuance no so the
02:04:21 person like that like
02:04:22 well listen you really should eat
02:04:24 healthier food why are we lying
02:04:26 why are we saying that these people
02:04:27 eating fast food why would like why are
02:04:29 we saying
02:04:29 fast food's bad doesn't mean being fat
02:04:31 is bad
02:04:32 well being fat is bad it's not healthy
02:04:35 it's not good for you but you can't
02:04:36 but i have good friends who are fat it's
02:04:38 like listen
02:04:39 people have problems yeah like i'm gonna
02:04:42 be i know
02:04:42 i know i'm gonna hit like 32 and
02:04:46 i'm just gonna oh yeah or you're gonna
02:04:47 crossfit you might go either way
02:04:49 maybe but my point is it doesn't mean
02:04:53 that fat is good for you just because
02:04:55 you love fat people
02:04:56 it's still bad for you like if you talk
02:04:58 to a doctor like you talk to a medical
02:05:00 doctor you're saying
02:05:01 yeah it's bad for you yes so it's not
02:05:03 good it's like pretending it's okay like
02:05:05 you could be healthy and fat is nonsense
02:05:07 but the thing is like if you say that
02:05:09 you're fat phobic
02:05:11 or you're you're fat shaming or you're
02:05:13 hurting people
02:05:14 but it's just a fact yeah it's it
02:05:16 doesn't mean you hate these people
02:05:18 yeah it just is what it is yeah that's a
02:05:20 problem whenever you can't say
02:05:22 what it is like no one can hear you're
02:05:25 just playing pretend
02:05:26 right so if a person says all these
02:05:27 things you agree with everyone and then
02:05:28 you find this one thing
02:05:30 instead of saying bob i'm totally with
02:05:32 you on all of that
02:05:34 but sometimes the people that are eating
02:05:36 fast food are just poor you're like
02:05:37 you're right
02:05:38 you're right i should have i sort of
02:05:39 twist that and that should be the end of
02:05:40 it yeah should give
02:05:42 a per person like when you have an
02:05:43 opinion if you put out a tweet like one
02:05:45 of the things i see people get attacked
02:05:47 the most for
02:05:48 is errant views and tweets but when you
02:05:50 have a tweet
02:05:52 and you put it out there that's not your
02:05:54 rock solid
02:05:56 married to position or anything it's a
02:05:58 thought
02:05:59 you're thinking out loud but you're
02:06:00 thinking in a typed form which is weird
02:06:02 yeah so if you see it in a type form
02:06:03 like if you said something fucked up to
02:06:05 me
02:06:06 but it was just in the moment you said
02:06:07 something you thought it was funny it
02:06:08 was fucked up
02:06:09 that's one thing but if you write it
02:06:11 down that's a different thing
02:06:13 totally and it's a thing we don't really
02:06:15 understand like you see something
02:06:16 written like i know what you said
02:06:17 but i'm going to decide that you meant
02:06:19 it this way and you can change it and
02:06:21 switch it around and move it
02:06:23 or you and we were talking about this
02:06:24 earlier you could even take a thing
02:06:26 that would make sense if you said it
02:06:28 like like how about
02:06:30 suck it bitch like if you just say that
02:06:31 out of nowhere and then but you write it
02:06:34 down it's like
02:06:34 what does that mean yeah where's that
02:06:36 coming from like in the moment it was
02:06:37 hilarious
02:06:38 but when you write it down and just
02:06:40 print it somewhere it's like what is
02:06:41 that because there's no tone no context
02:06:43 yeah
02:06:44 no context so and we're pretending this
02:06:46 is what everybody's doing
02:06:47 canceling people for tweets and getting
02:06:49 angry at people for things that they've
02:06:50 said
02:06:50 you're canceling people based on the
02:06:54 you're trying to deny nuance you're
02:06:56 trying to deny
02:06:58 that people shift and they grow and they
02:06:59 learn and that's the other thing it's
02:07:01 like i feel like everyone hopefully
02:07:03 you're like trying to grow as a person
02:07:05 and learn new things and have new ideas
02:07:08 and so it's like if i said something in
02:07:10 2014 it's probably
02:07:12 not how i feel about something now or
02:07:14 i'm fucking digging my heels in
02:07:15 yeah let me tell you why i believe it
02:07:17 yeah yeah
02:07:19 but i think i've said this before too
02:07:21 but i think the real problem is we can't
02:07:23 really read each other's minds
02:07:25 we rely on language yeah i don't know
02:07:27 what you're really thinking
02:07:28 yeah i don't know what you're really
02:07:30 thinking yeah you can pretend you know
02:07:31 some people are slicker with their words
02:07:34 some people are better convinced some
02:07:35 people have their game down some people
02:07:37 manipulated enough people that they're
02:07:39 you know like salesmen and shit or or
02:07:41 strippers like people are just like
02:07:43 really good at selling things yeah
02:07:44 they know they know what they're doing i
02:07:47 was learning
02:07:48 sign language before coping i would go
02:07:50 to like deaf meetups
02:07:53 there's like death meetups at starbucks
02:07:55 why were you doing that um
02:07:56 my grandma was deaf and i never took the
02:07:59 time to like really learn sign language
02:08:00 which now that i think about it is kind
02:08:02 of fucked up that's like if your grandma
02:08:03 spoke like italian
02:08:05 and only italian and you're like i'm
02:08:06 just gonna speak english and
02:08:08 hope you figure it out i would love to
02:08:09 see rose battle with sign language
02:08:11 oh that would be fi a lot of body
02:08:13 movements a lot of eyes
02:08:14 big that would be a great show that's
02:08:17 what netflix should do if they really
02:08:18 want to be inclusive
02:08:20 yeah there's more deaf people probably
02:08:22 than a lot of uh
02:08:25 malign people yeah what is this oh i
02:08:27 love interpreters at concerts that's
02:08:29 such an important job
02:08:32 when we were at the amphitheater when we
02:08:33 were at the amphitheater in the bay area
02:08:35 there was an interpreter and it made me
02:08:36 so happy
02:08:37 look how fast she's moving though she's
02:08:39 because they're rapping
02:08:41 eminem's rap god oh wow jesus christ
02:08:44 look at her go
02:08:46 sign language is so fascinating to me i
02:08:48 love it that's crazy like how look how
02:08:50 fast she's moving she's
02:08:51 talking she's take that chinese that's
02:08:54 what it is the chinese government is
02:08:55 tricking people into talking in sign
02:08:57 language
02:08:58 i'm on asl tick tock what does that mean
02:09:01 american sign language language tik tok
02:09:03 so there's people who like yeah
02:09:05 i love it i love sign language so you
02:09:07 tick talk using
02:09:08 actual words i don't but i watch people
02:09:11 who are either deaf or interpreters and
02:09:12 they make videos and sign language but
02:09:14 you're learning how to tic talk and sign
02:09:16 language at the same time
02:09:17 well i kind of stopped learning sign
02:09:19 language during the pandemic
02:09:21 oh is it one of those things you have to
02:09:23 stay up on like you have to sign with
02:09:24 people like
02:09:25 yeah it's like any language where it's
02:09:26 like if you want to get fluent in it you
02:09:28 want to be talking
02:09:29 in it all the time and i don't really
02:09:31 have a lot of deaf friends around to
02:09:34 speak to but it was cool going to like
02:09:36 those deaf meetups at starbucks
02:09:39 that is cool yeah it's an interest how
02:09:42 much do you really
02:09:43 understand a person based on sign
02:09:46 language do you
02:09:47 do you feel like you're not fluent at it
02:09:49 though right no but i
02:09:50 i i can sign decent enough
02:09:53 to have a conversation kind of yeah but
02:09:55 i would have to tell them like slow
02:09:57 slow but do you think that when you get
02:09:59 to a point like that
02:10:00 interpreter at the uh concert you get
02:10:03 that good at sign language
02:10:04 you could communicate as clearly yeah
02:10:06 but it's the same as any language where
02:10:09 it's like i might be like what's up
02:10:10 y'all it's lit
02:10:11 and you might be like oh i'm older i
02:10:13 don't understand what lit means
02:10:15 oh i know what lip means is i just
02:10:17 already gone away
02:10:19 i'm bringing it back tight
02:10:23 when you're like he's tight
02:10:26 but it's like if you go to a different
02:10:28 part like if if you go to a different
02:10:29 state sometimes the way that people
02:10:31 speak in maybe like in texas in certain
02:10:33 rural parts you wouldn't really
02:10:34 understand certain things that they say
02:10:36 or how they say them
02:10:37 so it's the same with sign language like
02:10:39 you can say doctor like this
02:10:40 or like this but if you're learning and
02:10:43 you only know this way to say it then if
02:10:45 someone does that you're like what the
02:10:46 fuck does that mean
02:10:47 um so doctors touch your wrist to check
02:10:50 your pulse like that yeah yeah and
02:10:51 there's a d
02:10:52 so a doctor oh where's the dude d
02:10:55 oh wow the letter but when you go down
02:10:57 and touch it now it because now it's
02:10:59 just doctor on your wrist i guess a p
02:11:01 that fell over on it yeah would anyone
02:11:03 there be different like not asl
02:11:04 because that's i didn't once i learned
02:11:06 american sign language i was like wait a
02:11:07 second
02:11:09 your french sign language yeah spanish
02:11:11 language
02:11:12 oh that's amazing language like how much
02:11:15 different is it
02:11:16 it's very different it's very different
02:11:18 so if you went over there
02:11:19 like you don't even know the language no
02:11:21 oh you fucks you had the one chance to
02:11:23 make universal language i know
02:11:26 it's so fascinating i'm like very
02:11:29 interested in like
02:11:30 the deaf community and sign language and
02:11:31 all of that linguistics
02:11:33 i got super high once i think it was in
02:11:35 the tank
02:11:36 and when i came out i had this idea that
02:11:39 alien
02:11:39 life if it wanted to communicate with us
02:11:43 would come up with a way like a type of
02:11:47 language
02:11:48 that everyone could understand like a
02:11:50 language that got right into your
02:11:52 brain a language that instead of you
02:11:54 having to interpret what the sounds mean
02:11:56 and turn them into words it's some new
02:11:58 kind of technology
02:11:59 that allow like as they're making this
02:12:01 sound as they're putting out the signal
02:12:03 it's going straight into you
02:12:05 and you automatically understand it yeah
02:12:07 without knowing what they're saying
02:12:09 without having actual
02:12:10 bob said you guys should come to the
02:12:12 spaceship instead of seeing
02:12:13 you know what it means without having
02:12:16 hearing sound like you'll have to
02:12:17 disassociate the idea of
02:12:19 these sounds meaning these words you'll
02:12:21 just know what it means
02:12:22 yeah the movie yeah oh that movie rivals
02:12:26 didn't they do it like visually yeah it
02:12:27 was like time doesn't matter
02:12:29 right there's no sentence it was all
02:12:30 memes and like right
02:12:32 it was like they would spray black ink
02:12:35 into the sky right what did they do for
02:12:36 length let me see what it looked like
02:12:38 again yeah there it goes they splay
02:12:40 spray black ink and it makes like weird
02:12:42 patterns
02:12:43 and that's how they um would communicate
02:12:45 does that make sense
02:12:47 yeah have you seen that new the trailer
02:12:49 for tenant is that what it's called
02:12:52 excited for the movie to come out for a
02:12:53 while yeah so i'm at the lockdown fucked
02:12:55 it up
02:12:56 i think there's a guy named ray kurzweil
02:12:59 and he's this brilliant guy who wants to
02:13:01 live to be a thousand years old
02:13:02 and he's got this um series of patents
02:13:05 that he's come up with
02:13:06 i mean he's really like a legitimately
02:13:09 genius guy and i got a chance to
02:13:10 interview him once a way back
02:13:12 but one of the things that we talked
02:13:13 about was he was talking about
02:13:16 downloading consciousness into a
02:13:18 computer
02:13:19 and they think that there's going to
02:13:20 come a point in time where you will be
02:13:22 eternal because you're going to
02:13:24 figure out a way to take whoever ally
02:13:26 mikowski is
02:13:27 and put it in a computer and download it
02:13:29 and your material body your physical
02:13:30 body
02:13:31 your biological body won't mean anything
02:13:33 anymore you're going to exist
02:13:35 as you inside this this computer
02:13:38 inside this thing i've always thought
02:13:41 that
02:13:42 that's probably what alien life is
02:13:45 what alien life is is something that has
02:13:47 gotten to the point where it doesn't
02:13:48 need a physical form anymore
02:13:50 like whatever consciousness is they
02:13:52 figured out a way to contain it in
02:13:54 non-biological systems so they take
02:13:56 whatever you are when you're born and
02:13:58 they but then the thing is like how does
02:13:59 that thing
02:14:00 replicate what are they doing to make it
02:14:02 what are they doing
02:14:03 how what are they doing to make sure the
02:14:05 power stays on like what are they doing
02:14:07 i think keto probably squats i think
02:14:11 life could be all kinds of shapes
02:14:14 i think life could be like there was
02:14:16 some speculations these scientists were
02:14:17 trying to figure out whether or not
02:14:18 light
02:14:19 could be a life form like there could be
02:14:21 a forms of life
02:14:23 that or made entirely of light well
02:14:26 everything's energy right
02:14:28 i don't know if everything's energy i
02:14:29 don't know i thought i'd throw that out
02:14:31 it really makes sense
02:14:32 just really lazy but like we're made of
02:14:35 energy you know
02:14:36 um yeah we're made of energy but what
02:14:39 would we think of as life
02:14:40 we think of as like a frog yeah or like
02:14:42 uh an ally makovsky or
02:14:44 jamie yeah but it's possible that life
02:14:47 might be
02:14:48 like i thought about ideas like when you
02:14:50 have an idea and then that idea gets in
02:14:52 your head like man i don't like that
02:14:53 idea
02:14:54 and then you you start working to
02:14:56 fulfill that idea you build a thing like
02:14:58 maybe you have an idea like how to build
02:15:00 a thing
02:15:00 and then you build a thing like that's a
02:15:02 thing that like
02:15:03 forced you to make it it's like
02:15:06 you had an idea that yeah bumped jumped
02:15:09 into your brain
02:15:10 and then it's like listen bitch you need
02:15:12 to make a canoe like a canoe
02:15:14 yeah how would i make a canoe you take a
02:15:15 log you fucking hollow out the side you
02:15:17 roll around inside of it
02:15:18 just go down the river and then all of a
02:15:20 sudden this idea that pops into your
02:15:22 head
02:15:22 and you start doing all the work now you
02:15:23 have a physical thing that literally
02:15:26 allowed itself to be born by getting
02:15:29 this idea that invades your
02:15:30 consciousness
02:15:31 and tricks you into making things
02:15:33 doesn't that make you think that
02:15:35 everything's already kind of decided
02:15:36 like
02:15:37 you know you have free will and control
02:15:40 but
02:15:40 to some extent everything's kind of
02:15:42 already what's gonna happen is gonna
02:15:44 happen
02:15:45 that's not necessarily true i think you
02:15:47 do have free will but i think you
02:15:48 also have determinism i think
02:15:52 this is something that people have
02:15:53 argued successfully where you
02:15:56 you really have to take a step back and
02:15:57 go okay what do i think about a person's
02:16:00 who a person is right now like if i meet
02:16:02 a person and uh i meet this woman and
02:16:04 she's all fucked up and she lies a lot
02:16:06 and she likes to do drugs and she
02:16:08 doesn't know what she's doing with her
02:16:09 life and she cries
02:16:10 like uh oh get your shit together bitch
02:16:13 is that what you think like how
02:16:14 what what do you think when you meet a
02:16:15 person like that do you take any
02:16:17 consideration like oh this is a person
02:16:18 who is the
02:16:20 granddaughter of alcoholics and it all
02:16:23 boiled down to genetics and terrible so
02:16:26 all of her systems that came online when
02:16:28 she was two
02:16:29 and five and six they all came online
02:16:31 during alcoholic households and people
02:16:33 were physically abusive and you're
02:16:35 hiding in the corner of your bedroom and
02:16:37 it was all chaos
02:16:39 drinking when you're 12 like when you
02:16:42 get to that
02:16:44 35 year old person and they've gone
02:16:46 through this
02:16:47 insane pattern without any intervention
02:16:49 nothing nothing switch
02:16:50 how much of their life are they really
02:16:52 responsible for yeah it's a real
02:16:53 question
02:16:54 it's like who are you you are the
02:16:56 combination of all the things that have
02:16:58 ever happened to you
02:16:59 your genetics all the weird shit that
02:17:02 you inherit from your parents
02:17:03 you inherit a lot of ideas they think
02:17:05 even from your parents
02:17:06 not just like learn from them but
02:17:08 actually inherit these ideas
02:17:10 and then you do the best with what you
02:17:13 got yeah
02:17:14 and some people's got is fucking
02:17:16 terrible
02:17:18 yeah do you think we're living in a
02:17:19 simulation
02:17:21 i'm too dumb same to
02:17:25 to take that into consideration but i
02:17:27 think it seems um
02:17:28 legitimately weird it does it
02:17:32 seems like it changes too much
02:17:35 like reality itself changes too much
02:17:38 yeah
02:17:39 and things come up that seem like if
02:17:41 there was going to be a simulation
02:17:44 this is how it would go down like like i
02:17:47 remember when i first started reading
02:17:48 about simulation theory was right around
02:17:50 the time where uh anthony weiner
02:17:52 got busted for sending pictures of his
02:17:55 deck like what are the odds
02:17:56 yeah like that seems like it's so on the
02:17:59 nose it seems like somebody's
02:18:01 if your name was wiener you'd avoid
02:18:03 showing people your heart yeah
02:18:04 like this is your turn castrate yourself
02:18:07 no more weiner
02:18:09 but if we're going to come up with one
02:18:10 someday obviously not you and me but
02:18:12 someone really smart it's going to come
02:18:13 up with a simulation
02:18:15 it's going to eventually get good enough
02:18:16 where you can't tell that you're in the
02:18:18 simulation
02:18:19 that's all fucked up that's what's
02:18:20 fucked up what's fucked up is it
02:18:22 if it isn't here it's coming yeah this
02:18:25 took me a long time
02:18:26 like i had a conversation with this guy
02:18:28 nick balstrom who's a
02:18:30 brilliant guy who is a big proponent of
02:18:35 this concept and he he was explaining it
02:18:38 through like probability theory yeah i
02:18:41 was a little too dumb to understand what
02:18:42 he was saying but
02:18:43 basically that's how you're listening to
02:18:44 your podcast if you do if
02:18:46 if it's possible that someday someone
02:18:48 essentially i'm i'm
02:18:49 paraphrasing someday we'll have a
02:18:52 simulation
02:18:53 like how what are the odds that this is
02:18:55 simulated it's more likely
02:18:57 that this is a simulation than not yeah
02:19:00 you just got to pray that whoever's
02:19:02 doing the simulation is looking out for
02:19:03 you
02:19:05 the other possibility is that we know
02:19:06 the simulation's coming
02:19:08 that's the other possibility and that's
02:19:09 why everybody's freaked out everybody's
02:19:11 freaked out because even
02:19:12 though it's not here it's inevitable if
02:19:14 you follow the pattern
02:19:15 of innovation if you go from pioneers
02:19:19 to people who live in cities to cell
02:19:22 phones and internet and
02:19:24 fucking space force and you just keep
02:19:26 going eventually you get to a point
02:19:28 where someone figures out how to make an
02:19:30 artificial version of life whether it's
02:19:31 ray kurzweil's thing
02:19:32 where it downloads you in your computer
02:19:34 or whether it's a thing you sit and
02:19:36 connect to
02:19:36 yeah there's some someone's gonna come
02:19:38 up with something do you think we know
02:19:39 that we're in the simulation when it
02:19:41 happens
02:19:41 or it would just like suck you don't
02:19:43 want that yeah no
02:19:44 you want something where it's crazy yeah
02:19:46 you don't even know you're in it like oh
02:19:48 my god am i in the simulation
02:19:50 who knows that's the best simulation the
02:19:53 best simulation is you
02:19:55 you have no idea oh yeah you're locked
02:19:57 completely into it
02:19:58 so that's where our problem lies we
02:20:00 don't know if that's actually going on
02:20:01 right now
02:20:03 like for trump if somebody brought trump
02:20:06 aside like sat trump aside said mr trump
02:20:09 all of this seems highly unlikely
02:20:10 doesn't it well here's why
02:20:12 yeah you are in a simulation this
02:20:15 simulation was started
02:20:17 78 years ago and this is the pattern it
02:20:19 plays out you you're you're given a
02:20:21 large amount of money
02:20:23 to uh start your own business yeah
02:20:25 you're gonna put your name on everything
02:20:27 you're gonna be the best the best the
02:20:28 best but you have crazy hair but that's
02:20:30 okay
02:20:30 you just fucking spray it down you're
02:20:32 good you have a few flaws in your life
02:20:34 people are mad at you though but you're
02:20:35 gonna be the best you're gonna have the
02:20:36 best things
02:20:37 the biggest you're gonna have the
02:20:38 business you know everything's gonna be
02:20:40 amazing
02:20:41 and then you you come up to him and like
02:20:43 you wake him up and you say listen that
02:20:44 this seems crazy
02:20:46 it seems crazy because it is and uh you
02:20:49 uh settled upon a very bizarre pattern
02:20:52 in your simulation
02:20:53 and this is how it came out and everyone
02:20:55 else is mad at you but they
02:20:56 don't understand this wasn't your fault
02:20:58 you didn't mean to but then you think of
02:21:00 all the things that we
02:21:01 counted before like poverty abuse drug
02:21:04 addict parents all the different things
02:21:06 that make a person who they are right
02:21:08 those are really kind of like
02:21:11 factors in if you had a game
02:21:14 like if you were playing some sort of a
02:21:16 large-scale role-playing game you're
02:21:18 like what is my character going to be
02:21:19 like oh your character's a barbarian
02:21:21 you're in the matrix that's what you're
02:21:23 showing me you're
02:21:24 describing like when morpheus talks to
02:21:26 neo he's like hey what do you what do
02:21:27 you think
02:21:28 but it is a central part of the
02:21:29 blueprint it's sent yeah it is like that
02:21:31 yeah and it is essentially what it will
02:21:33 be if we
02:21:34 if we're staying this human form
02:21:37 essentially someone's going to figure
02:21:38 out a way to put a helmet on you yeah
02:21:40 or s put a fucking spike in the back
02:21:42 your head that like locks your
02:21:43 central nervous system into this
02:21:45 gigantic computer that starts sending
02:21:47 signals to your brain and tricks your
02:21:49 brain to thinking it's riding on a horse
02:21:51 through the fucking
02:21:53 the saudi arabian desert that's going to
02:21:56 come
02:21:56 just whether or not it's here yet it's
02:21:58 going to come they're going to keep
02:22:00 making things if we don't blow each
02:22:01 other up
02:22:01 there's going to be a cell phone that
02:22:03 lets you see god you're going to you're
02:22:05 going to like call god
02:22:06 god's going to be in front of you
02:22:08 hugging you giving you love isn't that
02:22:09 what psychedelics are kind of like
02:22:11 yeah yeah well that could be what we're
02:22:14 trying to recreate
02:22:15 what we're trying to get to could be
02:22:16 like a state that's similar
02:22:18 to what exists already in nature like
02:22:21 maybe they're interconnected
02:22:22 in some sort of a way like maybe someone
02:22:23 will figure out maybe someone who is
02:22:25 anti-drug will figure out a way to
02:22:27 recreate
02:22:27 psychedelic experiences using only
02:22:29 technology that
02:22:30 interfaces with your brain and turns all
02:22:32 those chemicals on but don't you think
02:22:33 we're capable of doing that
02:22:35 ourselves because we're part of nature
02:22:37 in a way like we're all connected to the
02:22:39 universe in some way and so if we just
02:22:41 focused on
02:22:41 like not to sound like russell brand but
02:22:43 like if we all just like
02:22:44 took time to like meditate and like get
02:22:46 in contact with ourselves and like
02:22:48 realize that we're all connected
02:22:50 in a strange web that we could
02:22:52 potentially have that like
02:22:55 well that would definitely help yeah and
02:22:56 this is the other thing about people
02:22:58 that are like angry all the time or
02:22:59 people that are lashing out at people
02:23:00 all the time
02:23:01 that energy that you put out is it's not
02:23:03 a one-way thing
02:23:05 that it comes back at you totally and it
02:23:07 also makes you feel a certain way
02:23:09 so it's it poisons you as well well and
02:23:11 it poisons the other people
02:23:13 you know if i if i go and attack you and
02:23:15 i'm like joe you fucking whatever you
02:23:17 suck blah blah like
02:23:18 i'm attacking you then there's gonna be
02:23:21 i mean i know you're like tough and
02:23:22 whatever but like
02:23:24 you know there's still a part of that
02:23:25 energy the negative energy that's gonna
02:23:27 go into you and go
02:23:28 maybe for a second i don't know how long
02:23:30 but depending on how weak or
02:23:32 strong-willed or minded you are
02:23:34 you're going to attach part of that to
02:23:35 yourself and be like maybe i am bad
02:23:37 for sure i'll just lean into that some
02:23:39 people do some people definitely lean in
02:23:41 if you call them an asshole they just
02:23:42 become more of an asshole i think that
02:23:44 might be the case with trump
02:23:45 i think if you look at who he was before
02:23:48 he became president and like how um
02:23:50 antagonistic he is like now that he is
02:23:52 president i mean there was some of that
02:23:53 before like when you
02:23:54 get mad at rosie o'donnell or someone
02:23:56 and insult people
02:23:58 but it seems like now it's like way more
02:24:01 prevalent
02:24:02 in his behavior yeah i think a lot of
02:24:03 that is probably
02:24:05 connected to the fact that so many
02:24:06 people fucking hate him and they're
02:24:07 criticizing him
02:24:08 like his last days if you think about
02:24:11 who he is right he's 75 years old or
02:24:13 something like that
02:24:14 right he's so hot how old is he
02:24:20 somebody must think he's hot for sure
02:24:22 for sure for sure
02:24:25 just turned 74. do you think melania no
02:24:32 four years old you know that's um
02:24:37 such a weird age to have a president but
02:24:40 it but it
02:24:40 makes sense because then you learn a lot
02:24:42 from life but what i was going to say is
02:24:45 you generally you don't live to be much
02:24:48 older than 90.
02:24:50 most people that's so the last years
02:24:53 before that he's in rap songs
02:24:55 everybody's like he's got his own
02:24:56 show on nbc you're fired yeah everybody
02:24:59 loves when he does that i love when he
02:25:00 fires people
02:25:01 i love when he's mean he was the hero he
02:25:03 was like this guy
02:25:05 who was like this badass businessman
02:25:06 that had his name on everything and now
02:25:08 all sudden everybody hates them
02:25:09 but it's like what do you want
02:25:13 what do you really want because if you
02:25:15 want to be the top
02:25:16 guy you want to be the the president of
02:25:18 the united states
02:25:19 you want to be that one person that
02:25:20 dictates policy could literally change
02:25:22 the way
02:25:23 our society functions you have this
02:25:26 weird power
02:25:26 where if your friends go to jail you
02:25:28 could exonerate them ally
02:25:30 i'm gonna let you out i'm gonna give you
02:25:31 a presidential pardon we still have
02:25:33 presidential pardons
02:25:34 crazy like a person could just decide
02:25:36 they're the president so they get to do
02:25:38 it
02:25:38 like we let this medieval shit exist in
02:25:41 2020 where you could just decide
02:25:42 and i feel like most presidents don't do
02:25:44 much well they do a lot with it
02:25:46 really oh yes they do they pardon
02:25:49 hundreds of people there's so many
02:25:51 people in jail who don't need to be
02:25:53 that's true yeah well that's where
02:25:55 people like the innocence project and uh
02:25:57 these guys on my show yeah yeah yeah um
02:26:01 did you ever get into serial that
02:26:03 podcast about a non
02:26:04 cyan
02:26:08 it was like a super popular podcast
02:26:09 about this girl who was murdered
02:26:12 and they put her boyfriend in jail but
02:26:15 the story it's like
02:26:17 the podcast is them going into the story
02:26:19 and all the details and
02:26:20 uh and it's just interesting hearing
02:26:23 she was innocent i don't know that's up
02:26:26 to
02:26:27 the audience to decide yeah that's again
02:26:29 but he was like he was 17.
02:26:31 so i don't know part of me wants to be
02:26:34 i'm very naive and young and somewhat
02:26:37 dumb for the most part
02:26:38 and so there's part of me that's like
02:26:41 but if he did do it
02:26:42 right if he did murder his ex-girlfriend
02:26:45 and he was 17
02:26:47 and he's in jail for life no option of
02:26:49 parole at this point
02:26:51 and it's like don't i feel like prison
02:26:54 system should be able to have like a
02:26:56 rehabilitation process so that way
02:26:58 someone like him who might not
02:27:00 be a guy if even if he did it he's not
02:27:02 going to do it again
02:27:03 it's like do you know what i mean let me
02:27:06 take a breath
02:27:09 what are you trying to say if
02:27:12 if you go to jail for murder but you're
02:27:13 not the type of person who's like
02:27:16 you're not like a serial murderer you're
02:27:18 just like he was in high school maybe he
02:27:20 was misguided by his friends
02:27:21 he didn't know what to do ex-girlfriend
02:27:23 yeah um
02:27:25 diddy i don't know so there's two things
02:27:27 possible one
02:27:28 that's the thing if you kill your
02:27:30 girlfriend i think you forfeit your life
02:27:32 sure because if we don't have
02:27:34 unbelievably
02:27:35 strict rules like that yeah you're gonna
02:27:38 have people doing that more often yeah
02:27:39 there's
02:27:40 there is something that is a
02:27:44 there's something that influences people
02:27:46 to be good
02:27:47 and most of it is being a good person is
02:27:49 like feels good but part of it is
02:27:50 punishment
02:27:51 yeah part of his punitive stuff you can
02:27:53 think for life but here's the thing
02:27:55 you don't let me finish my sentence
02:27:56 because this is the most important part
02:27:58 we'd have to know for sure you did it
02:28:00 and i don't think they do that now so
02:28:02 that
02:28:02 that's one of the real problems we have
02:28:04 and then once you get into the system
02:28:06 even if they know you're innocent it
02:28:07 takes months sometimes before you get
02:28:09 out
02:28:09 right even if you have an appeal like
02:28:11 there's a lot going on there and that's
02:28:13 kind of the thing
02:28:14 that's the thing it's like you i think
02:28:16 that if you
02:28:17 take someone's life like that you
02:28:19 forfeit your life but how do i know you
02:28:21 did it
02:28:21 exactly how do i absolutely know you did
02:28:23 it because i definitely know that people
02:28:24 are in jail for shit they didn't do
02:28:26 yeah until you have a completely just
02:28:28 non-biased
02:28:30 justice system that it that
02:28:33 isn't pressured by you know different
02:28:36 attorneys or different
02:28:38 prosecuting attorneys or or governors or
02:28:41 anybody you just have this like
02:28:43 magical fucking super intelligent
02:28:46 group of humans that know exactly the
02:28:49 right choice
02:28:50 and how to punish someone we don't have
02:28:52 that
02:28:53 yeah so the death penalty and all that
02:28:56 shit it's like
02:28:57 yeah in theory i think you should kill
02:28:58 people that kill people yeah
02:29:00 in theory we want we don't want the
02:29:02 world to be filled with serial killers
02:29:03 we don't want someone who thinks it's
02:29:04 cool to
02:29:05 go to a park and shoot kids to stay
02:29:06 alive in theory i'm with you
02:29:08 the problem is when we don't know now if
02:29:10 we do know for sure this person did it
02:29:12 like there's video of them doing it but
02:29:14 even video now it's like fuck
02:29:16 yeah when is that going to be unreliable
02:29:18 yeah but
02:29:20 the thing is like with this guy there
02:29:22 wasn't enough i
02:29:23 personally think there wasn't enough
02:29:24 evidence to say 100
02:29:27 without a doubt he was guilty he should
02:29:28 be in jail for life and then it's like
02:29:30 okay so what if they prove that he is
02:29:32 innocent but he's been in jail since he
02:29:33 was 17 years old he's been in prison
02:29:35 since he was 17.
02:29:36 how old do you know i think this case
02:29:38 was in like 2000
02:29:39 early 2000s maybe 2003 and so now he's
02:29:43 only known his life as someone who's
02:29:44 been in the prison system
02:29:46 and maybe for something he didn't do
02:29:47 yeah and so if he gets out how is he
02:29:49 supposed
02:29:50 to be how's he supposed to know what to
02:29:52 do and be a productive member of society
02:29:55 the event that led to the case happened
02:29:57 in 1999
02:29:58 oh my god yeah
02:30:02 that's where it's horrific if someone's
02:30:03 innocent that's where it's horrific
02:30:06 and again i go back to this again but
02:30:07 this we got to be able to read each
02:30:08 other's minds
02:30:09 that's what they're going to say you
02:30:10 know how they're doing contact tracing
02:30:11 with covet
02:30:13 we need to know who you've contacted ali
02:30:15 ali if you've contacted someone as
02:30:16 positive we need to know and if you
02:30:18 haven't you should be able to go into
02:30:18 any restaurant you want just have your
02:30:20 app
02:30:20 ready and wear your wristband and this
02:30:23 is what we're probably going to do with
02:30:24 that too
02:30:25 but then isn't that like uh ali you
02:30:28 can't commit crime if i can read your
02:30:29 mind right and you don't want to commit
02:30:30 crime do you
02:30:31 no then let me read your mind just put
02:30:33 the helmet on we'll all read each
02:30:35 other's minds and no one ever goes to
02:30:37 jail unjustly
02:30:38 if your own privacy is more important
02:30:40 than all
02:30:41 these people that are doing life in
02:30:43 prison for shit they didn't do
02:30:45 what because you won't let people read
02:30:47 your mind and find out that
02:30:49 you masturbate to fucking feet
02:30:52 that's my thing i told you not to say
02:30:54 that on the podcast
02:30:56 dirty feet too i like hanging clay
02:31:01 i just picture that's what we're going
02:31:02 to do that's what's like the way it's a
02:31:04 slippery slope to contact tracing
02:31:06 because you want to keep people safe
02:31:08 it's going to be you want
02:31:10 don't you want no crime to exist don't
02:31:11 you want no people to be unjustly
02:31:13 punished then let us read your mind and
02:31:15 we're gonna just read each other's minds
02:31:16 i think the separation between each
02:31:17 other's thoughts like that we enjoy now
02:31:20 where you can deceive each other we can
02:31:21 you know you can spin a yarn or be a
02:31:24 good salesperson that shit's going out
02:31:25 the window that's like blockbuster video
02:31:27 that's going to be a useless thing
02:31:30 crazy that's what i think okay but i'm
02:31:32 dumb i might be wrong
02:31:34 same i might be wrong so
02:31:37 um let's wrap this up allie when uh when

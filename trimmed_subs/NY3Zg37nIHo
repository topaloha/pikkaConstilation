00:00:00 this is a great collection yeah this is
00:00:03 these are all from plastisol look even
00:00:05 the sunglasses come off on
00:00:07 wow yeah it's pretty dope
00:00:10 john wick john wick and his pitbull bull
00:00:16 awesome yeah i got kanye bruce lee
00:00:19 but the glasses are biggies i know well
00:00:21 this guy's amazing
00:00:23 shout out to fong from plasticile he
00:00:26 makes some dope shit
00:00:28 yeah he's amazing but not as amazing as
00:00:31 that shit you did in the green room man
00:00:33 david just did uh some card wizardry
00:00:36 that uh
00:00:37 it's one thing that you see when you see
00:00:39 that shit on tv like if i was there i'd
00:00:41 see some shit i know what's going on
00:00:43 but when you see it in real life you're
00:00:44 like what is happening here
00:00:47 yeah it's way better like uh in person
00:00:49 than
00:00:50 oh yeah well at the end i don't give
00:00:52 anything away but the end
00:00:53 literally a man is holding one of his
00:00:56 wrists and
00:00:56 another guy's holding the other wrist
00:00:58 and he still does the card trick and we
00:01:00 still can't figure out what happened
00:01:03 when did you get started how old were
00:01:05 you um so i i was about five years old
00:01:08 when i
00:01:08 started playing with cards but i didn't
00:01:10 know what what they were
00:01:12 for really so i just had a deck of cards
00:01:14 that i carried everywhere
00:01:16 but i liked the way it felt you know
00:01:17 just like it felt like something cool
00:01:20 so eventually a librarian was like oh we
00:01:23 got this like magic
00:01:25 self-working card trick booking do you
00:01:26 want to learn something
00:01:28 and i was like yeah of course
00:01:31 and she shows me the that silly
00:01:34 self-working mathematical trick that's a
00:01:36 long process to do but it's still a cool
00:01:39 outcome like oh i found your card right
00:01:41 right
00:01:42 and my mother i used to wait for her at
00:01:44 the library and she'd come get me when
00:01:46 she was done
00:01:47 and when she came i said can i show you
00:01:49 this trick and the librarian was excited
00:01:51 for me to do it to her
00:01:53 which is what i do to my friends kids i
00:01:55 teach them a trick and make them really
00:01:57 good at it and i'm so excited to see
00:01:59 them do it you know
00:02:00 right okay so my mother comes and i do
00:02:02 the trick
00:02:03 and my mom goes crazy like it was
00:02:07 like it was the best thing ever and so
00:02:10 like
00:02:10 but that began the love of wanting to
00:02:12 learn new tricks because i wanted to
00:02:13 keep making her
00:02:14 you know react you know happier so that
00:02:17 was
00:02:18 basically the fundamental start of it
00:02:19 and then also
00:02:21 she would take me to coney island all
00:02:23 the time and um you know
00:02:25 on the side on the boardwalk there
00:02:26 there's those weird
00:02:28 freak show performers stuff so i'd watch
00:02:30 those guys and it to me it was all like
00:02:32 magical so that that was kind of the
00:02:35 beginning of
00:02:36 it so isn't it funny how one positive
00:02:38 experience when you're young
00:02:40 can ignite this chain of events yeah
00:02:43 that changes your whole life
00:02:45 by the way and also so then the
00:02:48 librarian when i would come
00:02:50 she would give me books and i would
00:02:51 start looking at that little magic
00:02:53 section that was between like
00:02:55 games and puzzles i thought i always
00:02:57 wished magic would be like not there
00:02:59 like it should be like an art or so you
00:03:00 know just
00:03:01 it was always like when you want a magic
00:03:03 book it's always like that silly like
00:03:05 kids jokey thing but there's like so
00:03:08 in that section i pulled out a book
00:03:12 and i was like six years old and i see a
00:03:14 guy
00:03:15 chained to the side of a building
00:03:17 staring out looking like
00:03:19 death is upon him and that was her
00:03:21 dealing and i didn't know anything about
00:03:23 what that all meant i looked through the
00:03:25 pictures and he was hanging upside down
00:03:27 and stuff like that
00:03:28 but when i went to sleep i would have
00:03:29 these dreams of this guy chained to the
00:03:32 side of a building
00:03:33 and that began my curiosity and love of
00:03:36 of houdini and then that began my
00:03:38 curiosity of like
00:03:40 not just like the magic trick stuff but
00:03:42 like
00:03:43 this stuff that's to me it's more like
00:03:46 real
00:03:46 yeah how do those two worlds collide
00:03:49 because
00:03:49 some of the things you're doing they're
00:03:51 they're just insane
00:03:52 endurance and mental exercises
00:03:56 and then other things you're doing are
00:03:57 what you would consider
00:03:59 magic right so so i love both separately
00:04:02 like independently like i always love
00:04:04 like i had a
00:04:05 karate teacher at the ymca that used to
00:04:07 make us all run barefoot in the snow in
00:04:09 the winter in brooklyn
00:04:10 and all the kids were like you know
00:04:12 we're young we're like six seven and all
00:04:13 the kids like ah you know i'm afraid
00:04:15 they were gonna cut their feet on glass
00:04:17 whatever
00:04:17 and i would run in it and i felt like i
00:04:20 could do this
00:04:21 because i wasn't good at other things
00:04:23 physically like i was wanting my feet
00:04:24 turned in and stuff like that
00:04:26 so i felt like this i could do these
00:04:28 things so then
00:04:30 i learned how to hold my breath and the
00:04:32 reason i learned to hold my breath was
00:04:33 simply because i was on the swim team at
00:04:35 the y also
00:04:36 and the other kids would swim back and
00:04:38 forth and they'd destroy me because my
00:04:40 feet didn't function perfectly well
00:04:42 and what i learned is that if i didn't
00:04:44 breathe if i just swam
00:04:46 it would save me time because i didn't
00:04:47 have to move my head dip it out and you
00:04:49 know
00:04:50 right so i would just swim and the coach
00:04:52 would yell at me but suddenly i was
00:04:53 no longer in last place i was like now
00:04:55 second and sometimes
00:04:56 first and that began my like oh god
00:05:00 you can actually do what the coach
00:05:01 doesn't think is possible you could swim
00:05:03 there and back without breathing
00:05:04 and then the older kids would come to
00:05:06 see me do that and i would like
00:05:08 challenge them i'd be like
00:05:09 um let's see you could stay under the
00:05:11 longest and you can go
00:05:12 up and down five times i didn't
00:05:14 understand the physiology of it that
00:05:16 like going up and down doesn't help it's
00:05:18 more
00:05:18 effective to just sit through the pain
00:05:20 and just kind of chill
00:05:21 but i would just sit there and they'd go
00:05:23 up and come back down
00:05:24 which makes it worse that they'd be out
00:05:26 and i just doesn't make it worse
00:05:28 because uh the breath holding thing is
00:05:30 all about like a co2 buildup in your
00:05:32 bloodstream and it's about
00:05:33 a tolerance level to it so if you relax
00:05:36 and efficiently keep your oxygen
00:05:38 and not make this co2 build up more
00:05:39 extreme you can actually hold more
00:05:41 efficiently
00:05:42 so when you have that feeling everybody
00:05:44 has that feeling where you need to
00:05:45 breathe
00:05:46 that's it's not an o2 deprivation it's a
00:05:48 trigger from a co2 buildup which is
00:05:50 giving you an alert that
00:05:52 for example in 20 minutes from now
00:05:55 you will not recover and i didn't
00:05:57 believe that either some
00:05:59 a magician friend of mine who's amazing
00:06:01 um
00:06:02 and one of my like heroes in life
00:06:05 uh he he told me a story as i was doing
00:06:10 like buried alive i was saying he said
00:06:11 you know
00:06:13 you know the navy seals you know they
00:06:15 black them out under water
00:06:17 so they're not afraid of drowning and
00:06:19 i'm like that can't
00:06:20 no way like because it seems so abstract
00:06:23 to me you know
00:06:25 so but it stuck in my brain and then
00:06:28 when i wanted to do the water tank stunt
00:06:29 and i started learning about free diving
00:06:31 and stuff like that
00:06:32 i suddenly realized blacking out is
00:06:34 pretty straightforward like you black
00:06:36 out and then you get your head above the
00:06:37 water and if you're supervised you're
00:06:39 fine
00:06:39 so when i went to san diego with the
00:06:41 seals i watched what they do and i
00:06:43 actually did it but i didn't black out
00:06:44 it
00:06:45 went back and forth a few times and
00:06:46 pulled but they have that viewing pool
00:06:48 and they rope the seals up to some 45
00:06:50 pound weights and they have to walk
00:06:52 across the bottom of the pool and the
00:06:54 instructors are swimming above them
00:06:55 and when this when the seals black out
00:06:58 they cut the rope bring them up to the
00:06:59 top
00:06:59 and they're fine but what that teaches
00:07:01 you is that you do not need to worry
00:07:03 about being underwater because if you're
00:07:05 with a team and you but by the way
00:07:07 nobody should try this you know there is
00:07:10 extreme dangers to shall water blackouts
00:07:12 which lead to death but if you are
00:07:16 in somebody that's training and you have
00:07:18 a team and you want to push it
00:07:20 as soon as you black out it's like
00:07:21 getting knocked out it's it's but it
00:07:23 feels better it's not like getting
00:07:24 knocked out with a punch it's like
00:07:26 you're getting
00:07:26 choked it's your four no but no yeah but
00:07:29 choked out as euphoric
00:07:30 right yeah exactly except this one's
00:07:33 even better and then you have all these
00:07:34 dreams no
00:07:35 no it makes it sound exciting that part
00:07:38 of it
00:07:39 whenever i wake up from a blackout i'm
00:07:40 like whoa
00:07:42 that's how people wake up when they get
00:07:44 choked out really the same yeah when
00:07:45 people get choked out they wake up
00:07:47 almost like they were dreaming
00:07:48 like sometimes they think they're at a
00:07:49 disco yeah yeah yeah it's amazing and
00:07:52 they're like what
00:07:53 yeah wow and
00:07:56 it's not the best thing in the world for
00:07:58 you but it's way better for you than
00:07:59 getting knocked unconscious
00:08:01 yeah yeah it chokes the head yeah choked
00:08:03 out is just a it just
00:08:05 shuts off the blood to the brain right
00:08:07 and the brain shuts off yeah and then it
00:08:08 comes back online but there's no trauma
00:08:10 right yeah but it's not yeah so it's
00:08:13 like a shit yeah
00:08:13 blacking out under the blacking out
00:08:15 underwater thing probably not a good
00:08:17 idea to do too many times though right
00:08:18 no you could do it i mean i've blacked
00:08:20 out underwater a lot i mean
00:08:22 by the way so okay times i don't know
00:08:25 like
00:08:26 between 20 to 30. i mean i have like wow
00:08:29 by the way you guys were talking about
00:08:31 me on the thing about the breath hold
00:08:32 thing yeah so
00:08:33 yeah one time i went 20 minutes and two
00:08:35 seconds i almost did what you were
00:08:37 talking about the length of a show but i
00:08:38 did 20 minutes in two seconds and i had
00:08:40 telemetry there and i had pulmonary
00:08:42 experts and everything like that
00:08:43 and my heart rate dropped to eight beats
00:08:46 per minute
00:08:46 holy shit and they pulled me up because
00:08:49 they were freaked out
00:08:50 that's why you were dying yeah but back
00:08:52 to what i'm saying is
00:08:53 the reason besides the navy seal story
00:08:55 that i knew that it was
00:08:57 it made sense was because you hear about
00:08:59 the kids in the news like in 1984 or
00:09:01 whatever it was a kid was under an icy
00:09:03 river for 45 minutes
00:09:05 yeah with nothing
00:09:08 blacked out unconscious underwater for
00:09:10 45 minutes
00:09:12 they rescue him out pull him back
00:09:15 recover him in full recovery
00:09:18 so there's something that the body does
00:09:20 that we don't understand
00:09:22 it but if you actualize so because he
00:09:24 blacked out and because it was so cold
00:09:26 the blood shunting occurred we're all
00:09:27 like the same as when you get cold the
00:09:29 blood rushes away from the extremities
00:09:30 and protects the vital organs
00:09:32 and because he didn't inhale the water
00:09:35 because he was
00:09:36 completely out of it when they recovered
00:09:38 him they didn't even have to get water
00:09:39 out of his lungs and he was perfectly
00:09:41 fine
00:09:41 wow so but but that just shows you that
00:09:44 there's like a
00:09:45 certain levels of of what the body can
00:09:48 tolerate that
00:09:49 we have no idea so you
00:09:52 in in learning how to swim and learning
00:09:55 how to go all the way back and forth and
00:09:56 holding your breath this
00:09:57 started this idea of holding your breath
00:10:00 for an extreme long period of time like
00:10:01 what had been the record
00:10:03 before you would like 20 minutes and how
00:10:06 many seconds two seconds yeah that's
00:10:07 what you did
00:10:07 yeah but that's what happened what have
00:10:09 you done before that would have been
00:10:10 your record okay so when i was a kid i
00:10:12 heard
00:10:13 as i start reading about houdini his
00:10:15 like proud record of his lifetime and
00:10:17 he's the underwater escape
00:10:18 king for a hundred years ago and he had
00:10:20 he was around the best swimmers and he
00:10:22 had access
00:10:23 and he got up to three and a half
00:10:25 minutes so by the time i was like a
00:10:29 teenage early teenager i got to three
00:10:32 and a half minutes and did you think
00:10:33 that that was a barrier that couldn't be
00:10:35 crossed
00:10:36 well i came i blacked out as i came out
00:10:38 but i didn't know what that all meant
00:10:40 right so i blacked out was that so i was
00:10:43 like okay
00:10:43 that 330 seems like the edge
00:10:46 but then when i started working on the
00:10:49 actual concept of like how long can you
00:10:51 hold your breath for then i started
00:10:53 looking into it i'm like oh wow there's
00:10:54 like people that can do five minutes six
00:10:56 minutes seven minutes
00:10:57 and then there was a hypothetical record
00:10:59 of um
00:11:01 of uh a hypothetical
00:11:05 13-minute record but no evidence of it
00:11:07 and that was on pure02
00:11:09 so it was a hypothetical bureau two
00:11:10 record of 13. when you say on
00:11:13 too what's your process that flushes
00:11:15 everything out so you start
00:11:16 pure o2 yeah hold on to pure too yeah
00:11:19 and yeah i purge really hard on pure
00:11:21 tusa
00:11:23 which is like hypervent which gets rid
00:11:25 of the co2 and gives you more room for
00:11:26 oxygen
00:11:27 and by the way i just went up to 25 000
00:11:30 feet
00:11:30 in an airplane ascending at 500 feet per
00:11:33 minute
00:11:34 doors open and everything no oxygen and
00:11:37 i was with
00:11:38 luke akins who jumped from 25 000 feet
00:11:40 with no parachute landed in that he was
00:11:42 with me and two other
00:11:43 the pilot and two other guys we just
00:11:45 right under 25 those are 24 7 whatever
00:11:47 and um he's i said let's see who goes
00:11:51 hypoxic
00:11:52 first right so no no but we have no but
00:11:55 you have to take the ox the o2
00:11:57 you have to take the o2 monitors you
00:11:58 have to be on the right
00:12:00 so and i was already in a hypobaric
00:12:03 chamber with the fa
00:12:04 at oklahoma city and i started purging
00:12:06 just to see what it would do
00:12:08 and my levels my oxygen levels shot up
00:12:10 which nobody believes is possible
00:12:12 so i get into the airplane and we put
00:12:15 the monitors on and everybody's around
00:12:17 the same i was actually lower than luke
00:12:19 i was
00:12:19 like at 90 whatever 596. he was at like
00:12:22 97 he's like oh i'm going to go you know
00:12:24 joking with me
00:12:26 and as soon as we cross 15 000 feet
00:12:30 his slowly is starting to come down and
00:12:32 i start doing the breathing technique
00:12:33 the
00:12:37 purging out like i said right my oxygen
00:12:40 levels
00:12:41 and we filmed all this shot up to 98 and
00:12:44 then 99
00:12:46 is i went up to 23 plus
00:12:49 thousand feet now these guys think i'm a
00:12:52 magician so they're like yeah uh-huh
00:12:54 like fake news that's what he wrote on
00:12:56 the paper next to the levels because he
00:12:57 was recording it
00:12:59 so i took his monitor off of his finger
00:13:02 and he took mine i put his monitor on my
00:13:05 finger
00:13:06 put mine on his bang his was dropping
00:13:09 around 70 and mine was 98.99
00:13:12 then i switch with day i switch with
00:13:14 everybody on the plane and the oxygen
00:13:16 levels with the breathing all the way up
00:13:18 to that altitude
00:13:19 and i'm not recommending this because i
00:13:21 haven't tested enough and but
00:13:23 they did stay up at 98.99
00:13:26 and so my evidence for that was
00:13:29 you hear about all the sherpas that go
00:13:31 up to the top of everest
00:13:32 up to 29 000 feet and they're not
00:13:36 bringing oxygen i get it they're
00:13:37 acclimating six but they're still
00:13:39 at 29 plus thousand feet so they're
00:13:42 doing
00:13:43 something that's allowing them to rewire
00:13:45 their ability to not go hypoxic
00:13:49 so this breathing technique you're
00:13:51 essentially exhaling more than you're
00:13:52 breathing in so you're breathing a small
00:13:54 amount in
00:13:55 and then i fill up everything for
00:14:00 full but i mean full like top to bottom
00:14:02 hold for a second and then
00:14:05 exhale slowly and i like for example if
00:14:07 when
00:14:08 when we're done here if you have 20
00:14:09 minutes i'll get you up to a four and a
00:14:11 half minute breath hold
00:14:13 in 20 minutes and this is just through
00:14:16 these breathing techniques yeah
00:14:17 when we're done with this i'll show you
00:14:19 how to do it and you will get up to four
00:14:21 plus minutes for sure and how did you
00:14:24 so you you've learned that you could go
00:14:26 three and a half minutes or three
00:14:28 minutes plus right and yeah and
00:14:30 and blackout and then how did you have
00:14:32 it in your head
00:14:34 that you were going to eventually get to
00:14:36 20 minutes okay so
00:14:37 you really ought to hear all that yeah
00:14:38 yeah it's a long i'll go let's go
00:14:40 okay and i forget where i'm going okay
00:14:42 it's okay so you might have to remind me
00:14:44 where we're going
00:14:45 yeah okay i just want to know the
00:14:47 process because okay yeah but it's a
00:14:48 little
00:14:48 magician by trade well but first of all
00:14:51 i like houdini so i
00:14:52 love magic but i like houdini and
00:14:54 houdini was like king of cards as well
00:14:56 but he's a guy that's doing real things
00:14:58 right and then i like guys that are like
00:14:59 as i go i go to the museum of
00:15:01 broadcasting because there was no
00:15:03 youtube or whatever so i'd look at like
00:15:04 these magic you search magic
00:15:06 and i'd find like guys that would like
00:15:08 drink a gallon
00:15:09 of water drink a liter of kerosene he
00:15:12 would float all the kerosene on top of
00:15:14 the water
00:15:15 and then he would spit out kerosene out
00:15:17 of his mouth look like a human dragon
00:15:19 and then put the fire out with a gallon
00:15:21 of water
00:15:22 so it's that it is magic but it's
00:15:25 it's art it's mind-blowing it's an art
00:15:28 it's a performance p
00:15:29 it's not like it's incredible now look
00:15:31 there's guys that are
00:15:32 card guys that are like that also like
00:15:35 lots lots of people i love and
00:15:37 they do the cards in a way that's like
00:15:39 but but
00:15:40 that act to me was what pressed a button
00:15:43 it was like
00:15:43 whoa like how is he converting his body
00:15:47 to do a trick
00:15:48 and there's a guy today performing
00:15:49 called stevie star who's called the
00:15:51 human regurgitator but
00:15:53 he swallows crazy things like so
00:15:56 he combines magic with his abilities so
00:15:59 like he went on jay leno or one yeah i
00:16:00 think it was leonard carson
00:16:03 he takes you know the little film
00:16:04 canisters that used to drink
00:16:06 so he puts a film canister empty
00:16:09 closes it for the you know you get the
00:16:11 35 and then he goes
00:16:13 and then he swallows it so it's in it's
00:16:15 yeah it's gone
00:16:17 and he goes like that's gone then he
00:16:19 would take
00:16:20 a bunch of water drink that and then
00:16:23 there'd be a cup with a goldfish in it
00:16:25 drinks the cup and the goldfish and then
00:16:27 you have jay leno sign the cap
00:16:29 the the lid thing to the thing with a
00:16:32 piece of tape and sign it
00:16:34 right then he'd take that and go now
00:16:36 everything is gone
00:16:37 then he does these weird sounds and
00:16:39 movements which is part of his show
00:16:41 right and then he brings it up spits it
00:16:43 out
00:16:44 and the film canister is sealed
00:16:48 and it is the water and the fish and
00:16:51 it's sealed with the signature
00:16:53 so to me that's like the coolest magic
00:16:56 because your take
00:16:57 because when you see a trick you know
00:16:59 like oh that's cool but it's a trick so
00:17:01 it's like you're being removed from
00:17:03 being able to like
00:17:04 absorb but when you see somewhere
00:17:05 somebody's doing something crazy and it
00:17:07 seems like a trick but it's also like
00:17:09 wait this is real
00:17:10 because he's really doing this it's just
00:17:12 way more exciting you know
00:17:14 i understand i understand it's just
00:17:17 do you know how he did that one
00:17:19 obviously yeah i talked to him yeah i
00:17:21 talked to him all the time
00:17:22 yeah i love steve stevie star you know
00:17:25 how it was done
00:17:26 but you can't reveal that right yeah he
00:17:28 and and okay there's another guy tom
00:17:30 mullika who
00:17:30 he passed away and he was this guy he's
00:17:34 the first magician ever so he did a
00:17:35 simple card trick and i was crying
00:17:38 i was like in tears i was like oh my god
00:17:41 but
00:17:41 he and he passed away and i filmed that
00:17:43 and and he's
00:17:44 i'm gonna do a really amazing piece
00:17:46 about him because he is incredible but
00:17:48 he also was on like uh johnny carson
00:17:50 shows what he would do is he would take
00:17:54 a pack of cigarettes
00:17:55 throw them into his mouth one at a time
00:17:57 light them on fire
00:17:58 bring them back out and then throw them
00:18:00 into his mouth one time eat all the
00:18:02 cigarettes
00:18:03 yes there he is so
00:18:06 and watch he eats the cigarettes wow
00:18:08 that's great how fast they pulled that
00:18:10 up
00:18:10 it's not day it's young jamie oh it's
00:18:12 you he's a wizard yeah
00:18:14 he's a wizard of mine look so he takes
00:18:16 by the way this act killed him so that's
00:18:17 how dedicated to his craft he did it
00:18:19 really
00:18:20 yeah look he he was eating a pack of
00:18:22 cigarettes every night
00:18:23 on stage and swallowed
00:18:26 a yeah and then but wait he also throws
00:18:30 him into his mouth like
00:18:31 oh my god so now he's chewing him
00:18:35 watch what is he chewing he's just
00:18:37 amazing but hold on
00:18:38 i get to where he's throwing them into
00:18:39 his mouth too oh boy
00:18:42 yes he throws him into his mouth one of
00:18:43 the time they're lit he chews them up
00:18:45 swallows them his mouth is lighting
00:18:47 look at the ladies what the fuck am i
00:18:49 doing here
00:18:50 oh my god look at that stack in his
00:18:52 mouth
00:18:53 and then look the whole thing goes in by
00:18:56 the way he also throws him one at a time
00:18:58 does all that puts the paper in oh
00:19:01 jesus christ and swallows it all
00:19:06 that's it oh my god yep he
00:19:10 he's so so how did this kill him
00:19:13 every single night just 20. he shows a
00:19:16 night at a bar
00:19:17 doing cigarettes in your mouth on fire
00:19:19 eating them
00:19:20 swallowing them right but what killed
00:19:24 yeah yeah boy yeah but wait so
00:19:28 um so he spits them out eventually or he
00:19:30 just swallows him
00:19:31 i'm not gonna give away his genius right
00:19:35 in the video do they ever come out no no
00:19:37 they're gone they just yeah yeah
00:19:38 yeah see that's the thing it's like this
00:19:41 is a guy that died for his
00:19:42 art legitimately yeah wow
00:19:46 but so another the guy was telling you
00:19:48 about that's like my favorite card
00:19:49 the guy that taught that showed me the
00:19:51 navy seal but just an amazing just as a
00:19:53 library
00:19:54 he um he's like this genius that if he
00:19:56 came here which he never would because
00:19:58 he would never show anybody
00:19:59 anything but if he did and he showed you
00:20:02 a couple of moves
00:20:03 like the first move he showed me was
00:20:04 actually a card move called ascension
00:20:07 where he makes the card float right
00:20:09 through the deck and like the greatest
00:20:10 magician of all time the card magician
00:20:12 said it was one of the greatest tricks
00:20:14 ever done you won't be able to find it
00:20:15 anywhere because it's not a video
00:20:16 but he um he only does it to a couple of
00:20:19 magicians
00:20:20 so he performs for like you know a
00:20:22 handful of his friends
00:20:24 he shows a move and it's mind-blowing
00:20:27 and
00:20:27 luckily he showed me stuff when i was
00:20:28 young but
00:20:30 he'll never ever perform he's like does
00:20:32 a painter paint so he can show people or
00:20:34 does a painter paint to paint
00:20:36 but whenever you're on the phone with
00:20:37 him you just hear cards like he's like
00:20:40 and he's doing no and he's doing it he's
00:20:42 doing i'm telling you like 13 day long
00:20:44 13 hours a day he's doing card moves
00:20:47 alone
00:20:47 and i said but i was like bill what do
00:20:49 you do do you like do the trick to
00:20:50 yourself and be like ah
00:20:52 how did i do that you know what i mean
00:20:55 but he said he doesn't believe that it's
00:20:56 not to him it's not a performance
00:20:58 to him it's it's just about the
00:21:00 technical love and feel of
00:21:02 of that well that's that there's a
00:21:03 japanese phrase for that about doing
00:21:05 something
00:21:06 over and over and over and over the
00:21:08 exact same thing over and over again
00:21:10 until you achieve a level of perfection
00:21:12 that is almost physically unattainable
00:21:15 to
00:21:16 mere mortals you you bypass
00:21:19 what a person thinks the the body would
00:21:21 be capable of doing
00:21:22 yep yeah that that's that's it that's it
00:21:25 yeah that's what he's doing that is the
00:21:26 thing like if you can
00:21:28 you know james nestor is yeah of course
00:21:31 he wrote the book d
00:21:32 yes yeah deep is amazing uh i don't know
00:21:34 deep but
00:21:35 that's the book yeah breath is the one
00:21:37 that i read and i had him on the podcast
00:21:39 he's amazing he was talking about this
00:21:41 monk that uh
00:21:42 was literally meditating and
00:21:46 doing breathing exercises all day long
00:21:48 for 30 years
00:21:50 and could do these insane things with
00:21:51 his body like vary the temperature from
00:21:54 one hand to another change the blood
00:21:56 flow
00:21:56 to change it literally from one finger
00:21:58 to this for sure and that
00:21:59 yeah you're the only way you could get
00:22:02 to that place
00:22:03 is you have to be that guy who sits in a
00:22:04 cave and does breath work
00:22:07 all day long for 30 years and most
00:22:09 people just aren't willing to do that
00:22:10 but if you do do that
00:22:12 there are some levels that you can reach
00:22:15 that are just unattainable to a normal
00:22:18 person and even
00:22:19 if you would talk to but i agree with
00:22:21 the scientists and the doctors no but it
00:22:22 is attainable to normal
00:22:24 people because when somebody gets
00:22:26 paralyzed or something right i've seen
00:22:28 people that the doctors say you're done
00:22:29 you have no shot
00:22:30 and they spend all day of every single
00:22:33 waking moment trying to get like a
00:22:34 little mo
00:22:35 just like a tiny bit of movement in
00:22:37 their little toe and eventually if
00:22:40 they do what you're saying yes so it it
00:22:43 is that
00:22:43 yeah it is that it's but most people are
00:22:46 not
00:22:47 willing to get to that place most people
00:22:49 are not going to sit there shuffling
00:22:50 cars 13 hours a day like your friend
00:22:52 yeah but there's people that can do that
00:22:55 like when i was watching you move the
00:22:56 cards around
00:22:57 well it's interesting like you ever
00:22:59 watch a movie where a guy smoking a
00:23:00 cigarette you know that guy doesn't
00:23:01 really smoke
00:23:02 you can kind of tell by the way he's
00:23:04 holding the cigarette it feels good
00:23:06 that's good you're moving these cards
00:23:08 around like your
00:23:09 your edge detection like your
00:23:11 understanding of where the edge
00:23:13 it's very interesting to watch your
00:23:15 fingers move because they're so
00:23:17 they're so educated you know um because
00:23:20 of uh
00:23:20 all the commentary that i do with
00:23:22 martial arts and my years in martial
00:23:24 arts
00:23:25 it's i'm fascinated by how different
00:23:28 people move and they do the same thing
00:23:30 they it looks different when other
00:23:32 people do it there's certain people that
00:23:33 will throw a punch
00:23:34 and you just walk into you you go jesus
00:23:36 there's something about the
00:23:38 the fluidity of the motion that's
00:23:40 stunning even to this day
00:23:42 and that was just when i was watching
00:23:43 you move your fingers and watching you
00:23:45 move the cards like this motherfucker i
00:23:47 shuffled a lot of cards
00:23:49 there's a weirdness to the the movement
00:23:51 of your hands
00:23:52 but i think it's what you're saying it's
00:23:53 like the punch thing it's like there's
00:23:54 yes yeah
00:23:55 yeah but it's uh it is but it's it's
00:23:59 the you you the mind forces the body
00:24:03 into moving over and over and over again
00:24:05 you know
00:24:06 you do it to this level of perfection
00:24:10 that you d for a person like me who
00:24:12 doesn't know anything about cards i
00:24:13 don't know anything about car tricks i
00:24:15 don't know how they work
00:24:16 i can't shuffle if you watch me shuffle
00:24:17 you'd fucking laugh at me
00:24:19 but i watch your your hand movements i'm
00:24:21 like oh
00:24:23 this is amazing it's amazing but now
00:24:25 there's guys that i'm around
00:24:27 that i wouldn't even pull a deck of
00:24:29 cards out of my pocket if they're near
00:24:30 me because they're that guy that does it
00:24:32 13 hours yeah like yeah like
00:24:35 like the guy just that's what he's done
00:24:36 fascinating though but
00:24:38 yeah but there's also different aspects
00:24:39 of it but so like you know there's also
00:24:42 guys
00:24:44 i can't i'm not gonna go with the
00:24:46 details okay
00:24:47 but i met i feel like i shouldn't even
00:24:50 say this but it's fine
00:24:51 because it's fine so i met a kid once
00:24:55 who moved to las vegas when he was
00:24:58 this is a crazy story to tell damn
00:25:02 but it's a good story okay i won't go
00:25:04 into details
00:25:05 so he moved to las vegas when he was 12.
00:25:09 he moved there because he wanted to meet
00:25:11 a specific person who was considered
00:25:14 the best card sheet ever meaning the guy
00:25:18 this is a guy that the reason that vegas
00:25:21 has
00:25:22 those instead of like the dealer peeking
00:25:24 the
00:25:25 the down card they have to put it into a
00:25:28 machine and push a button
00:25:30 he's the guy that the movie casino was
00:25:32 built around with the computer in the
00:25:33 shoe like he was the
00:25:35 the best card she ever
00:25:38 but among magicians he's like a
00:25:40 phenomenon because he's working on moves
00:25:42 not to entertain
00:25:43 anybody he's working on moves so he
00:25:46 doesn't get his hands smashed up against
00:25:48 the wall
00:25:49 binions right so he's working on moosa
00:25:53 he's not going to get killed
00:25:54 survival yes yeah so right so
00:25:59 this kid at the age of 12 knows about
00:26:02 him
00:26:03 moves to las vegas and buys a crap
00:26:06 stable
00:26:08 he puts the craps table it's him and his
00:26:10 mom right it was my the
00:26:12 single mother and him they live in this
00:26:14 small apartment very close to
00:26:16 the man i was telling you about and this
00:26:19 kid throws dice
00:26:21 15 hours a day on this craps table by
00:26:24 the way their
00:26:25 little bed is like under the table you
00:26:27 know i mean it's a small space and it's
00:26:28 a real
00:26:29 crap stable like a nice one the only
00:26:32 thing he does is
00:26:33 repetitiously throw that and he can
00:26:35 helicopter spin the dice
00:26:37 so you can't see them doing this they
00:26:39 have such force going around this way
00:26:41 that when they hit the wall
00:26:43 one die won't break the number and he
00:26:45 can throw it exactly to this
00:26:47 part of the of the table missing this
00:26:49 from across the table so that one guy
00:26:51 locks and every time he can guarantee
00:26:53 that number
00:26:54 he did that every day for almost a
00:26:57 decade until he could throw dice better
00:26:59 than any other human being in the world
00:27:02 then he went and got a job at one of the
00:27:04 casinos that texts for
00:27:05 car cheats and worked in the craps
00:27:08 tables
00:27:09 it's all he did and as soon as he turned
00:27:11 21
00:27:12 he went out travels the world and wins
00:27:15 the exact amount of money that he should
00:27:16 when playing craps where you're not
00:27:18 detected but
00:27:20 but you can what is the exact amount i
00:27:22 mean i under
00:27:23 you know probably under a million yeah
00:27:25 probably a few million a year so if i'm
00:27:27 saying it's not like he's going in and
00:27:28 getting really it's it's very smart and
00:27:30 structured
00:27:31 yeah and that's going to different
00:27:33 places and he can throw dice like i've
00:27:35 never seen anybody throw dice
00:27:37 it's crazy i know that they take people
00:27:39 that are really good at cards like my
00:27:41 friend dana white has been
00:27:43 barred from casinos because he wins at
00:27:45 blackjack he's probably just counting
00:27:47 i don't know what he's doing yeah he's
00:27:48 counting but they've they've kicked him
00:27:49 out of casinos because he's won
00:27:51 a lot of money but he's also lost a lot
00:27:53 of money which is bizarre to me that you
00:27:54 can go to a place
00:27:55 and do really well and they're like
00:27:57 you're doing too well you got to get out
00:27:58 of here well they also it says mine
00:27:59 everything we have the
00:28:01 right to refuse anybody which is
00:28:03 important because do they do that with
00:28:05 dice is the question i forget that how
00:28:07 they would do that okay
00:28:08 do you want to hear a dice story but
00:28:09 this isn't me doing magic this is luck
00:28:11 okay okay so i don't believe you it is i
00:28:14 don't like the way you paused
00:28:17 but but i'm serious i know but i'm
00:28:19 saying that because i'm trying to be
00:28:20 convincing okay okay
00:28:22 so because i'm telling the truth but
00:28:24 anyway
00:28:25 i go to the palms you know the yeah okay
00:28:28 and um
00:28:29 they had a bet on the crabs table called
00:28:31 the fire bet and
00:28:32 it was like a a game where you have to
00:28:34 hit all the numbers open and close
00:28:36 without
00:28:37 but crapping out so
00:28:40 when i walk up to the table right away
00:28:43 the
00:28:44 the pit boss and everybody they make a
00:28:46 big deal like you can't touch the dice
00:28:47 and they're like i said you can call up
00:28:49 i can touch the dice because
00:28:51 you know they invite me so i can touch
00:28:53 the dice
00:28:54 and uh because i i wanted to throw right
00:28:58 i don't want to just gamble on a rant so
00:29:00 anyway i um
00:29:01 because even though i'm not cheating i
00:29:03 still feel like you know maybe i'll get
00:29:06 i have a little bit of an ability that's
00:29:08 giving you know what i mean
00:29:09 right not a cheating ability but maybe
00:29:11 i'm a little better than a random person
00:29:13 i don't know
00:29:14 right got it so the pit ball
00:29:18 they make a joke and then the woman
00:29:19 pitbull comes out she says well if you
00:29:21 take your shirt off we'll let you throw
00:29:22 the dice
00:29:23 joking right so anyway what i do is i
00:29:25 bet for
00:29:26 everybody at the in this i go to the low
00:29:28 stakes table always so the high stakes
00:29:30 able's that super bowl team right over
00:29:31 there and they're like ah
00:29:32 they're all crazy right like all excited
00:29:34 with these big bets
00:29:36 over here with this table we all have
00:29:38 little bats right that i say let's put a
00:29:40 fire bet down for everybody
00:29:42 so i put the fire bit down for every
00:29:44 single person at the table
00:29:45 including the dealers the i mean the
00:29:47 pitbull you know the
00:29:49 you know with the dicing and uh i'm
00:29:51 throwing the dice throwing the dice
00:29:54 this goes on for two and a half hours i
00:29:56 keep throwing the dice
00:29:58 i didn't hit us i didn't crap out i hit
00:30:00 sevens in between each number which you
00:30:02 can
00:30:02 craps work so you have to roll like a
00:30:05 five let's say and then i'm like oh no i
00:30:06 need to roll another
00:30:08 five which is statistically much more
00:30:10 difficult than a seven because seven is
00:30:12 the most
00:30:12 common number to come up so if you roll
00:30:14 a five you're like uh oh that's hard
00:30:16 because you can only get a two three or
00:30:18 a three two
00:30:19 on both dice or a one four or 4 1. so
00:30:22 you have a
00:30:23 4 out of 36 so it's a 1 and 9. so you're
00:30:26 probably going to crap out before you
00:30:27 get the number that's why the game is
00:30:29 to their favor so i'm throwing the dice
00:30:34 and it's two and a half hours later and
00:30:37 they stop everything and they're like
00:30:41 your fire bet just hit
00:30:45 and the table goes what does that mean
00:30:46 they go well you all just won
00:30:48 like 10 grand each and they'll go ah
00:30:52 like everybody's go they gave me the
00:30:53 taser everybody's going nuts and we hit
00:30:55 the fire bet which they've now removed
00:30:57 from the palms by the way but it was
00:30:59 it was a pretty unheard of like the odds
00:31:01 of hitting that bet is
00:31:03 pretty rare but it's just luck
00:31:07 nobody should hit that bet i mean
00:31:09 statistically it's unlikely and i wasn't
00:31:12 cheating
00:31:13 so yeah so
00:31:16 do they but the the question is i'm
00:31:18 lucky
00:31:19 for some reason i'm light i'm lucky with
00:31:21 dice right but i'm not i
00:31:23 but i can tell you i would be if i was
00:31:24 great with dice i'd tell you i was good
00:31:26 by the way i actually have a thigh on me
00:31:30 i didn't even hear this story for this
00:31:31 reason but i do have a die on me
00:31:34 have you practiced with dice um no yes
00:31:37 but i'm terrible at it so or do i do
00:31:39 i do have a diet but it does make sense
00:31:41 that if
00:31:42 you look at what that is that that's a
00:31:45 physical thing
00:31:46 and then if you develop a touch you
00:31:48 develop a feel
00:31:50 you do something over and over and over
00:31:51 well this is different but here look
00:31:53 take the die
00:31:54 okay and and uh can you like
00:31:57 uh put it between your hand or whatever
00:31:59 like uh and can you mix it like that
00:32:02 and then squeeze it when you're done or
00:32:04 no keep it hidden but put it on the
00:32:05 table but make sure you can't see it and
00:32:07 i can't see it
00:32:08 you agree like no one could see that
00:32:10 right are you sure 100
00:32:12 do you want to do it again try it again
00:32:13 just know because it could be weighted
00:32:15 so just
00:32:15 or you're done you're good yeah you're
00:32:17 good yeah okay uh
00:32:19 say a number between one and six like
00:32:21 pick a number up to six
00:32:22 okay that five is what i said on the
00:32:24 craps table right but
00:32:26 but i already know that it's a four
00:32:29 and the five is here basically
00:32:32 how do you know that that's
00:32:35 uncomfortable
00:32:39 can you do that again probably not
00:32:42 so you know what we'll do stop but stop
00:32:44 whatever you want yeah because it could
00:32:46 be like a way to die by the way that's
00:32:48 how people cheat
00:32:49 with dices they also take the dye and
00:32:51 they flip it
00:32:52 and they want it to be you know so it's
00:32:54 like you throw the numbers so you said
00:32:56 you wanted a five right yeah
00:32:58 go ahead yeah it's five get that voodoo
00:33:01 away from me man
00:33:02 the fuck is that
00:33:07 that's so weird that must be a rush for
00:33:09 you though just to blow people's minds
00:33:11 like that all the time
00:33:12 but see so it's not you don't i don't
00:33:14 think of it so what happens is the
00:33:16 digital fixation part of like the love
00:33:18 of just like learning something new and
00:33:20 exciting that's
00:33:20 that's like really the the stimulus is
00:33:23 like that
00:33:24 that fixation almost it's like the
00:33:26 meditative thing that you're talking
00:33:27 about but
00:33:28 but as a magician that is performing and
00:33:30 trying to make tv shows it's really
00:33:32 difficult because you have to like keep
00:33:33 coming up with new things which is
00:33:36 that's hard to do how did you first
00:33:39 get on television how did you convince
00:33:41 someone to let you try this on
00:33:42 television well
00:33:44 so back in those days the only magic
00:33:45 that you could see and like i said it
00:33:47 was pre you couldn't go
00:33:48 watch it or get it or any so there's no
00:33:50 way to see magic and if you were me
00:33:52 with a single mother in brooklyn or
00:33:54 whatever how you gonna go
00:33:56 there's no magic i never went to a magic
00:33:58 show
00:34:00 so what happened was all those world's
00:34:03 greatest tv specials were playing and
00:34:05 they were called world's greatest men
00:34:06 and i would watch them and they were
00:34:08 like the opposite of that they were like
00:34:10 not they were like hard to watch you
00:34:13 know it was like glossy big
00:34:15 like dynamic and illusionist is so far
00:34:17 away from the whole thing so
00:34:19 i'm like there's nothing magical about
00:34:21 all this and then um
00:34:24 so okay i i i think about it and i'm
00:34:28 like
00:34:29 i go through up so but i'm doing magic
00:34:31 everywhere all the time so
00:34:33 one of the ways i'm making money is i'm
00:34:35 going into those fancy restaurants in
00:34:36 new york city like those
00:34:38 upper park avenue and i do magic to the
00:34:41 you know to the manager
00:34:42 to this and i'm like if uh
00:34:45 can i do magic to the table and it's
00:34:47 like what i did to you there like do the
00:34:49 magic like oh that's great
00:34:50 i was like could i do magic to the
00:34:51 people eating and i won't ask him for
00:34:53 anything
00:34:53 i bought like a nice suit at century 21
00:34:56 like a hundred dollar jacket was
00:34:58 tattooed but
00:34:59 anyways i go up to these tables and
00:35:02 that's
00:35:03 a hard situation because it's very
00:35:05 difficult to approach people that do not
00:35:08 want you near them
00:35:09 and try to figure out how to win with
00:35:10 magic it's a com and it's like
00:35:12 even on the street wherever you do it
00:35:14 it's like a complicated scenario
00:35:16 once the camera comes up it changes it
00:35:18 because now they're like oh he has a
00:35:19 camera it's fine right
00:35:21 but you'd have to walk up to a table of
00:35:23 a people a bunch like us we're sitting
00:35:25 there
00:35:25 and some like you know sketchy magician
00:35:28 kid
00:35:29 comes up to us like hey can i show you a
00:35:31 card trick and you and i
00:35:32 are gonna be like nice to him probably
00:35:33 but not really whatever out
00:35:35 right so what i had to learn quickly was
00:35:38 like little things that are so important
00:35:40 like distance like how close should you
00:35:43 be to the table or how
00:35:44 far and then you start to really
00:35:46 understand the psychology of the magic
00:35:48 is way more important than the tricks
00:35:50 right so if you're too
00:35:51 close you're like over you're they don't
00:35:54 want you near them so you're right
00:35:55 you get you're like they're like no
00:35:57 thank you if you're too far away it's
00:35:59 easy for them to say no thank you right
00:36:01 so there's like a balancing point just
00:36:03 on where you stand
00:36:05 and then who you do the first trick to
00:36:07 and then what the first trick is and
00:36:08 so by doing all this i started to really
00:36:10 figure out how to get reactions from
00:36:12 anybody really fast so i could walk up
00:36:15 to anybody
00:36:16 anywhere and just do magic like one time
00:36:19 i was in um
00:36:20 central booking because i jumped the
00:36:21 subway thing they were sweeping
00:36:22 everybody up
00:36:24 and there was four guys sitting in the
00:36:26 middle playing spades
00:36:28 the only other like kid that looked like
00:36:30 me that was in there got the shit kicked
00:36:32 out of him right
00:36:33 and i'm like i'm gonna get my ass kicked
00:36:35 right because i was with a button-up
00:36:36 shirt like you know
00:36:37 anyway so the guys are sitting in the
00:36:40 middle
00:36:40 uh that were playing spades i grabbed it
00:36:42 i go let me show you guys something i
00:36:43 take the come on
00:36:44 i grab the deck of cards and i start
00:36:46 doing magic to the four
00:36:48 toughest looking guys in the cell right
00:36:50 within two minutes
00:36:52 they're erupting and once they're
00:36:53 erupting the whole everybody because
00:36:55 central books are moved here everybody's
00:36:57 standing around going nuts and then all
00:36:59 of a sudden
00:37:00 the guards are there and now everybody's
00:37:02 watching together and i'm like
00:37:03 this is what the magic show needs to be
00:37:05 like whether you're like here or this
00:37:08 whether you're this that whether you're
00:37:09 young old witch poor black white
00:37:11 whatever everybody wants to see it
00:37:13 no no everybody's got a good side like
00:37:16 there's
00:37:16 i want to show the that people are all
00:37:18 the same you know like
00:37:20 sure there's some that are horrific and
00:37:22 do horrible but at the core of
00:37:24 everybody there's like an innocent kid
00:37:26 somewhere maybe he got really
00:37:27 far lost and magic just pulls that out
00:37:30 of people
00:37:31 you know and that's why and the people
00:37:33 say oh well how could you do magic
00:37:35 i do magic to anybody because whether
00:37:38 it's like visiting
00:37:38 underage kids in prison that like you
00:37:41 don't know what happened to them
00:37:42 and you see them come walking up with
00:37:44 their eyes down they don't want to look
00:37:45 at you because they don't like anybody
00:37:47 there that's authority right that's what
00:37:48 ruined their lives
00:37:50 and then as soon as you do these tricks
00:37:51 suddenly they're like
00:37:53 little happy sweet kids ah
00:37:56 you get the you get that and that's what
00:37:59 and that's what magic did originally to
00:38:00 my mom like i would do it to her
00:38:02 and she'd be like reacting and even if
00:38:04 she had a terrible day you know she was
00:38:05 working three jobs it was like
00:38:07 this made her happy wow
00:38:10 that's that's a cool origin story that
00:38:13 and it makes sense that that feeling
00:38:15 that you get
00:38:16 like when you show so many like in you
00:38:17 like the card trick you did in the other
00:38:19 room and everybody's like oh
00:38:21 that that oh the oh that you get out of
00:38:22 people that that rush
00:38:24 that's that that is because at that
00:38:27 moment no one's thinking of anything
00:38:28 else
00:38:29 at that moment they're like what the
00:38:31 fuck how did you
00:38:32 what oh and by the way i've walked
00:38:35 many times when people were fighting
00:38:37 about to erupt into big fights i walked
00:38:39 into the middle of those fights
00:38:41 started doing magic and those fights no
00:38:43 i know but and then the fights were done
00:38:46 and everybody's like what do you want to
00:38:47 hear the funniest non-magical magic
00:38:49 story
00:38:50 sure okay so after the tv show comes out
00:38:53 stuff like that i get more known by the
00:38:54 way it's a world's greasy but then i was
00:38:56 like okay let me do the opposite of that
00:38:57 so i called it street magic because i
00:38:59 was trying to come up with the
00:39:00 lowest name like i was trying to come up
00:39:01 with center expectations as low as
00:39:04 possible
00:39:05 right because the world's greatest like
00:39:08 so i come i'm doing like card tricks
00:39:10 right but anyway so
00:39:12 i'm like driving with my friend at his
00:39:14 uh one of those those smart cars in new
00:39:16 york and it's like the coldest day in
00:39:18 new york it's like
00:39:19 freezing like a february like 12 degrees
00:39:22 out type situation
00:39:24 and um we're stuck at a red light
00:39:28 and there's a car with these four people
00:39:30 outside of it
00:39:31 and there you could see they're like
00:39:33 struggling like they couldn't get the
00:39:35 door open so they realized they
00:39:37 and they didn't they lost their keys
00:39:39 they couldn't figure it out they
00:39:40 couldn't get into their car
00:39:41 right but i know that that's not what's
00:39:44 going on like
00:39:45 it's freezing so i understand the
00:39:46 situation so i go doug
00:39:48 stop one second and i walk up next to
00:39:51 these
00:39:52 this group walk up to the car pull the
00:39:55 door open
00:39:56 but i like it made it look like i'm just
00:39:58 pulling but i was giving it for
00:39:59 the door opens up and it looks like i
00:40:01 did nothing it did i get back at the
00:40:03 card leave and i hear they go down steve
00:40:05 they got it was like the best trick i
00:40:07 ever did but it was just opening up a
00:40:08 door in a frozen night because i knew
00:40:10 that it was just frozen
00:40:14 but that's the same as what magic is
00:40:15 it's like it's like and when
00:40:17 yeah so the and the whole so that
00:40:19 there's a book called magic and
00:40:20 showmanship which is
00:40:21 all about like what makes magic
00:40:23 effective and it's called like the ham
00:40:25 sandwich
00:40:26 he says if you just said reach in your
00:40:28 pocket right now there's a ham sandwich
00:40:30 that's a good trick but if you were like
00:40:31 man i'm hungry i would love a hand
00:40:33 sandwich
00:40:33 and i'd already put it there and i'm
00:40:35 like reaching your pocket and then
00:40:36 there's
00:40:37 that's real magic so it's just context
00:40:41 that's where it's so baffling because
00:40:43 then people walk away how the fuck did
00:40:44 he know i was going to say a ham
00:40:45 sandwich
00:40:47 like the folded car that you somehow
00:40:49 another shoved into jeff's wrist into
00:40:52 his
00:40:52 below his watch we're all like okay what
00:40:56 i mean i know there's something to it i
00:40:58 don't know what you're doing but
00:41:00 that oh the result the o is uh pretty
00:41:03 pretty phenomenal but in that moment no
00:41:05 one's thinking of anything else
00:41:07 uh yeah but it's sure no but there's
00:41:10 also a lot of people that are trying to
00:41:12 figure it out they're skeptical
00:41:13 but they're still going ah they're not
00:41:15 even if they're trying to figure it out
00:41:17 they're not thinking of anything other
00:41:18 than that trick
00:41:20 that moment something yeah they might be
00:41:22 trying to figure it out but they're
00:41:23 still they're not thinking about
00:41:25 oh i gotta feed the dog you know they're
00:41:27 they're thinking about that
00:41:28 they're like good friends of mine
00:41:29 they're doing magic they're like okay
00:41:35 yeah we can all get uh too accustomed to
00:41:37 things yeah
00:41:39 so you you first get on television you
00:41:42 first
00:41:42 do these things and then your magic
00:41:44 evolves
00:41:45 and your magic goes from being just
00:41:48 magic to some of the
00:41:50 more insane things you've done like
00:41:51 standing in a block of ice for how long
00:41:53 did you do it for seven days like 63
00:41:55 hours
00:41:56 i'm always late so i showed up late so i
00:41:58 missed like what i
00:41:59 the length of time i was supposed to do
00:42:01 so that's all but i'm always late
00:42:03 i made it here on time though didn't i
00:42:05 you were early yeah yeah
00:42:06 perfect but i rode the motorcycle here
00:42:09 and was flying because
00:42:10 i had to make i wanted to be on time so
00:42:12 i flew you were on time yeah
00:42:14 um the the ice thing why what made you
00:42:17 decide to stand in a block of ice okay
00:42:19 60 plus hours well so i'll tell you that
00:42:21 so you were saying how do you go from
00:42:23 the magic tricks like to these extreme
00:42:25 physical endurance and
00:42:26 so studying houdini and all that stuff
00:42:28 and then there's a poster of houdini
00:42:30 that i loved where he was it was
00:42:32 he was buried alive but he never did the
00:42:33 stunt he died before he got to do but he
00:42:35 was gonna get buried alive underground
00:42:37 in a coffin
00:42:38 so i i stare at i love that poster since
00:42:41 i was a kid it's like in the magic books
00:42:43 you see that poster
00:42:44 yeah in any way so bill again the guy i
00:42:46 told you about bill kalush
00:42:48 comes up to me and he's like what about
00:42:49 this and he shows me an image of a
00:42:51 indian fakira that was buried alive for
00:42:53 a month he's like what if you pretend to
00:42:55 be buried alive in central park we'll
00:42:56 sneak you out and you'll come back a
00:42:58 month later
00:42:59 and i was like i always wanted to do
00:43:02 like houdini-like things
00:43:03 but i never wanted to copy but that one
00:43:05 he never did so i was kind of like well
00:43:07 that's interesting
00:43:08 but what if instead of doing it the way
00:43:10 he did it what if i did it
00:43:13 and everybody could see that i was
00:43:14 buried alive so what if i was really
00:43:17 just buried alive like it can't be that
00:43:19 hard
00:43:19 he's like yeah you can't do that and i
00:43:21 was staying at his place so we got a
00:43:23 coffin
00:43:24 from queens where actually houdini was
00:43:26 buried i bought a coffin we brought it
00:43:27 back to his house
00:43:28 and then i would just practice sleeping
00:43:30 in the coffin then suddenly yeah
00:43:32 i know but then suddenly i realize you
00:43:33 don't eat food and then if you have a
00:43:34 little thing to go to the bathroom i did
00:43:36 four days like nothing so i'm like okay
00:43:37 i can do a week
00:43:38 and that was it and then then i pushed
00:43:41 the idea of doing the bird alive and
00:43:42 and convinced people to let me do it
00:43:44 publicly and what's funny is
00:43:46 like firemen and stuff like would come
00:43:48 to the stunt in the middle of the night
00:43:50 and they would shine like holograms at
00:43:52 me and their lights and stuff
00:43:53 and they oh that's the ice but and then
00:43:55 they would assume that i wasn't
00:43:57 actually in there okay so here so back
00:44:00 to this one
00:44:01 well well let's go but but let's let's
00:44:03 not jump around
00:44:04 the so the buried alive thing yeah where
00:44:06 did you do it physically where
00:44:08 um that was in new york city on the west
00:44:10 side uh
00:44:11 trump had like this uh bunch of
00:44:13 properties that he was developing
00:44:15 and i was like uh i want to be buried
00:44:17 alive on one of your properties
00:44:19 is that possible he's like sure he just
00:44:20 sent me his driver and i went around and
00:44:23 that's where i did my first thought and
00:44:24 it was how could they see you though and
00:44:26 then jimmy
00:44:28 who i do who like oh there you go yeah
00:44:30 so it was see-through but right
00:44:31 and then we put six tons of water on top
00:44:33 of it so that's basically it
00:44:35 and then so i was there and how are you
00:44:38 getting that
00:44:39 there was hal see those two big holes so
00:44:41 the oxygen was being see the holes above
00:44:42 my head
00:44:43 right there so the air was being blown
00:44:46 in and out but it's pretty
00:44:47 straightforward like
00:44:48 that one's not to me not that impressive
00:44:50 like if i said to you you just laid
00:44:51 there for a week
00:44:52 yeah that you know what the harder the
00:44:54 hard part i mean sure you
00:44:56 body and you lose right now but the hard
00:44:58 part of it is um
00:45:00 and you wouldn't you would never
00:45:02 anticipate this being the hard part
00:45:04 but if you're not used to like peeing
00:45:06 while standing in front of lots of
00:45:08 people
00:45:09 staring at you it's actually really hard
00:45:11 so so i'd be buried alive and i had the
00:45:13 trucker's tube on and all that stuff
00:45:14 which is like a con with a catheter or
00:45:16 whatever
00:45:17 and um and people are there the whole
00:45:19 time like it suddenly became like an
00:45:21 event and so there was never
00:45:23 like and i was they were like oh we'll
00:45:25 cover it so no one can see i'm like no
00:45:27 then people are going to think i'm
00:45:28 sneaking in and out so i had to learn
00:45:30 so i would close my eyes like when you
00:45:32 were a kid sleeping and you would have
00:45:34 those dreams i'd have bachelors
00:45:36 and it would take me hours and i'd
00:45:38 finally be able to pee
00:45:39 right but that and by the way i didn't
00:45:41 eat for a few weeks before so i
00:45:43 had no foods that was the other wasn't
00:45:44 an issue but um what happened by midway
00:45:47 through the stunt people i'd be waving
00:45:49 and smiling
00:45:50 and like and it was like nothing you
00:45:53 know but these are things that you don't
00:45:54 consider when you're
00:45:56 practicing in your coffin in your house
00:45:58 so you you didn't eat for how long two
00:46:00 weeks before
00:46:01 yeah yeah but i i was always into
00:46:02 fasting i read sid artha as a kid
00:46:05 and i had done like uh a week with just
00:46:08 water and you know knew all that knew
00:46:10 the body is really good with that
00:46:12 so you were comfortable with the fact
00:46:14 that you were able to fast and
00:46:16 that that wouldn't be an issue yeah and
00:46:18 you were comfortable with the fact that
00:46:19 you were getting air and where are you
00:46:20 drinking water from how you getting
00:46:22 water oh i had like a little bit of
00:46:24 water in there that i could suck to a
00:46:25 thing
00:46:26 like that and that was fine it was like
00:46:28 it was enough
00:46:29 how much water do you think you drank
00:46:30 over the week that you were in there
00:46:32 uh i i don't know they always say it was
00:46:34 like just a little bit but it was a good
00:46:36 amount it was like uh
00:46:37 i don't know probably probably
00:46:41 three liters a day or something oh okay
00:46:44 yeah that's real yeah they say he did
00:46:45 tablespoons of it but no it was
00:46:46 it was it was like a normal amount so
00:46:50 by the way i did 44 days with nothing
00:46:52 but water and i did nothing but
00:46:54 pure h2o so it's not even like it had
00:46:56 minerals in it
00:46:57 and body was full recovery and my
00:46:59 starvation expert who's like one of the
00:47:01 top guys in the world
00:47:02 in london my doctor at the end thought
00:47:04 that i was cheating
00:47:05 so they put me on and i distilled water
00:47:08 it was a company called h2o and they're
00:47:11 things it's just
00:47:11 pure yeah just exactly distilled right
00:47:14 so
00:47:15 right which which is irrelevant by the
00:47:18 way but so
00:47:19 i had nothing but pure h2o for 44 days
00:47:24 lost 60 pounds bmi bone mass index
00:47:27 dropped
00:47:28 33 percent yeah people that's what i was
00:47:30 getting yeah no no it was bad no it
00:47:32 wasn't
00:47:32 yeah it wasn't good but doctor thought i
00:47:35 was cheating because he's a magician by
00:47:36 the way
00:47:37 my friends that were with me that are
00:47:39 you know magicians and the guy building
00:47:41 they're like you need to take these
00:47:42 vitamins and they hand me a handful
00:47:45 of sugary vitamins and i'm like no
00:47:48 it's just because i if i'm gonna do it i
00:47:50 want to like actually do it right right
00:47:52 and um if i would have taken those
00:47:54 vitamins i feel like my metabolism
00:47:56 wouldn't have gone into starvation
00:47:57 and i might have had irreversible damage
00:48:00 from it
00:48:00 so the fact that i actually did it i
00:48:02 went into starvation mode and the body
00:48:04 protects itself but what i was saying is
00:48:07 the starvation expert that now i have a
00:48:08 paper published
00:48:09 in the new england journal medicine with
00:48:11 him which i'm pretty proud about
00:48:12 but um he he didn't believe me so he put
00:48:15 me on an iv and right away the phosphate
00:48:17 levels reacted and i almost went into
00:48:19 shock
00:48:20 so i almost actually did die when they
00:48:22 refit fed me so his paper is called the
00:48:24 refeeding syndrome
00:48:26 they say like after world war ii when
00:48:27 they rescued the from the
00:48:29 from the camps the jews and everybody
00:48:31 was starving the camps
00:48:33 and they a lot of soldiers gave them
00:48:34 like candy bars and stuff and all of a
00:48:36 sudden their systems
00:48:37 went into shock and they died from not
00:48:40 being refed the right way
00:48:41 so what is the correct way to re-feed
00:48:43 someone if they haven't eaten you have
00:48:44 to slowly bring them back so that you
00:48:46 don't have what happened to me which is
00:48:48 phosphate levels
00:48:49 go all crazy so very small amounts of
00:48:51 food yeah but then two days later i
00:48:54 somebody sent me a trunk from harrods
00:48:56 full of food
00:48:57 in london like a friend and uh
00:49:00 and i was giving it to all the nurses
00:49:02 and doctors because i knew i shouldn't
00:49:03 eat it and i was trying to do it right
00:49:04 then like in the middle of the night
00:49:06 i woke up and had like a bag of potato
00:49:08 chips right
00:49:09 and then um a bagel a creature and i was
00:49:12 wrecked it was like the most
00:49:14 i also didn't go to the bathroom for a
00:49:16 month and a half
00:49:18 what think about that
00:49:21 so how long does it take you to recover
00:49:23 from one of these things
00:49:25 that one i feel like i never fully
00:49:26 recovered from but
00:49:30 i don't know i wouldn't recommend
00:49:31 anybody does that like goes like super
00:49:33 super long with no food but
00:49:35 but by the way so there's no you don't
00:49:37 think you ever recover yeah
00:49:39 my body always goes like this now it's
00:49:41 always confused when i like train i go
00:49:43 up
00:49:44 down really quick really easy and it was
00:49:45 since that sorry because you thought
00:49:46 your body freaked out because it wasn't
00:49:48 when you started
00:49:48 yeah i feel like that yeah you know but
00:49:50 there's no way to prove that but
00:49:52 um that's a common thing though with
00:49:54 people who cut weight for fights
00:49:55 really yeah they get to a certain point
00:49:57 they have kidney failure
00:49:58 and yeah yeah and then that's why right
00:50:01 exactly that's what happened to me and i
00:50:02 keep having problems with my kidneys
00:50:04 yes yeah yeah and i have a spot on my
00:50:07 kidney right now
00:50:08 mm-hmm yeah yeah
00:50:11 yeah that's uh that's a real common one
00:50:14 with guys uh daniel cormier actually had
00:50:16 to drop out of the olympics because of
00:50:17 that
00:50:18 i didn't know that his kidneys failed
00:50:20 yeah kidney failure is a big one with uh
00:50:22 fighters kidney stones too for a lot of
00:50:24 guys wait
00:50:26 so you're that was probably in your
00:50:28 opinion the one that damaged you the
00:50:30 most
00:50:31 or left the most residual so the most
00:50:33 difficult one was the ice
00:50:35 by far the the ice was a monster and the
00:50:39 reason why
00:50:40 was because and now there's also
00:50:42 something great about it so
00:50:44 it was a warm november so the air coming
00:50:46 through was like
00:50:47 you know it happened to be a 68 degree
00:50:50 three-day spread which led to the ice
00:50:53 keep
00:50:54 dripping the cold on me and it's
00:50:56 radiating this way but i'm also standing
00:50:58 up in one spot completely still and you
00:51:00 can't sleep because if you fall asleep
00:51:01 when you're present to ice you get
00:51:03 frostbite you have to cut your skin off
00:51:04 right
00:51:05 so i'm staying completely awake the
00:51:07 entire time
00:51:09 and it's a difficult situation on hour
00:51:11 55
00:51:12 exactly if i look back at all of it my
00:51:14 friends knew
00:51:16 my eyes just go out and i'm now
00:51:18 hallucinating
00:51:19 like you could never ever there no
00:51:22 hallucinogenic drug will
00:51:24 ever give you those kind of
00:51:25 hallucinations like what was it
00:51:28 first of all it's amazing but it's also
00:51:30 when it goes into that nightmare part
00:51:32 it's scary
00:51:34 but there's also that amazing part of it
00:51:36 and if you have people
00:51:37 after that stunt now whenever i
00:51:39 hallucinate on stunts i have
00:51:40 friends there that i say i'm gonna start
00:51:42 hallucinating just talk me through it
00:51:45 but so here's when i started realizing
00:51:47 that i was hallucinating because you
00:51:48 don't know when you are right
00:51:50 um and by the way the one stunt i never
00:51:52 did was sleep deprivation
00:51:54 if you remind me i'll explain that whole
00:51:55 thing but i'll forget but so
00:51:58 um so what happens is when i start
00:52:00 realizing it is i need to know
00:52:02 uh like what time it is because i'm done
00:52:05 at 10 p.m because it was live on abc so
00:52:07 i'm like
00:52:07 i need to know how much longer i got to
00:52:09 go through this right because it's
00:52:10 getting tough
00:52:11 so and it's there the by the way and my
00:52:14 doorman would come in like
00:52:16 news or whatever fox news said david
00:52:18 blaine
00:52:19 um is not really the i they did a
00:52:21 special on it a
00:52:22 an hour-long special on fox saying that
00:52:25 i was never in the ice and i had a
00:52:26 double
00:52:27 of me that was in the ice i'm switching
00:52:29 up and down with the
00:52:30 eating burgers and readings
00:52:34 stations oh yeah yeah so they did but
00:52:37 they did a one-hour special that i was
00:52:38 never in there so my dorm
00:52:40 how do they get away with doing that i
00:52:41 don't know i don't care but listen so my
00:52:42 doormat my doorman who comes to
00:52:44 this is the funny part though so my
00:52:46 doorman that comes to see me
00:52:49 he he's um he knows me so well he's
00:52:52 buried alive and he's so nice right
00:52:54 so he comes to visit me in new york and
00:52:56 uh he he walks up to the ice
00:52:59 and he sees me and he's looking at me
00:53:00 all weird i wasn't hallucinating it
00:53:02 looked at me all weird then he leaves
00:53:04 and then when i go back i was like
00:53:06 what's up he's like
00:53:09 that are you sure that that was you and
00:53:12 ice
00:53:13 could that have been you i was like what
00:53:15 do you mean eddie he's like
00:53:17 okay well it's you know so he we go on
00:53:20 that special heirs now he's convinced
00:53:23 that it wasn't me and i
00:53:24 especially is why you're still no no
00:53:26 that's after but he already
00:53:28 thinks because he doesn't believe it my
00:53:31 friends my best friends when i was
00:53:32 buried alive
00:53:33 they didn't think i was really doing it
00:53:36 they thought it was a trick
00:53:37 right so so he he asked me he's like
00:53:41 there's
00:53:42 was that really you because they said
00:53:43 that you were a double of yourself and
00:53:45 you were
00:53:46 switching and i was like eddie but you
00:53:48 looked at me
00:53:49 like how could if i have a twin brother
00:53:52 like where is that identical twin
00:53:54 brother
00:53:55 and why why would i switch up so anyway
00:53:57 but so back to the um
00:53:59 back to the when i get to 55 hours so
00:54:02 i'm looking
00:54:02 around and i need the time so i go like
00:54:04 this like
00:54:06 what time is it and the guy goes
00:54:12 402 yeah so he shows me 402.
00:54:15 so i'm like okay that means we have like
00:54:17 another six hours or whatever it is
00:54:19 right
00:54:19 and by the way my time estimations are
00:54:21 so i'm like okay
00:54:23 wait it might have been too way
00:54:26 way way and i wait and i'm indoor it's
00:54:29 hard
00:54:29 i'm like things are moving everything's
00:54:31 weird spiders are walking up people are
00:54:33 like sitting in the ice
00:54:35 i'm waiting waiting voices are talking
00:54:38 to me that i'm talking back to
00:54:39 right but i'm waiting i'm waiting and i
00:54:42 wait
00:54:42 for like a few hours before i ask
00:54:45 anybody the time again
00:54:47 and i see somebody and i'm like
00:54:51 and the guy and the guy goes
00:54:55 four oh three oh no
00:54:59 and that's when it all crashed out it
00:55:01 was like when that went up
00:55:03 that connection and then the
00:55:04 hallucinations were just rampant and my
00:55:06 eyes were all crazy when the
00:55:08 drill was when the chainsaw was coming
00:55:09 through i tried to grab it
00:55:11 yeah so yeah see look at that oh you're
00:55:14 gone
00:55:15 but okay but sudden but now that i've
00:55:17 learned that
00:55:18 sleep deprivation is one of the
00:55:22 most amazing ways if it's controlled
00:55:25 to go to another place it's like that
00:55:29 but i want to get to that before we get
00:55:31 to that like
00:55:32 while you're in there what are you doing
00:55:34 to occupy your mind like
00:55:36 how are did you have were you using
00:55:38 meditation were you just
00:55:40 thinking were you just winging it like
00:55:42 so okay so
00:55:44 for some of them what i do a big first
00:55:46 of all yeah a lot of things you get to
00:55:47 you have free time to think like there's
00:55:49 no
00:55:49 phones no distractions so aside from the
00:55:52 physic
00:55:53 but but the one thing that i use with
00:55:55 everything is kind of like a breakdown
00:55:57 of numbers i'm like okay
00:55:59 this much i have to get to this point
00:56:01 then when i get to this point even when
00:56:02 i run on a treadmill i'm like okay i
00:56:03 have to get to this point which means
00:56:05 let me get to the halfway point and i'll
00:56:06 consider that
00:56:07 when i'm holding my breath i do the same
00:56:09 thing like okay i need to get to 15
00:56:11 minutes so let me get to seven and i'll
00:56:13 start at seven then at seven i'm like
00:56:15 okay i'm at seven left i have to get to
00:56:16 another three and a half then three and
00:56:17 a half
00:56:18 and then what i always do is whenever
00:56:20 i'm training i always go past it so it's
00:56:22 the same thing so like when i'm running
00:56:23 a treadmill
00:56:24 i'm like if i have to do let's say like
00:56:26 you know 3.1 whatever it is
00:56:29 i set that as my target but then i
00:56:31 always go like another
00:56:32 half a mile past it because i won't you
00:56:35 can't quit before because then you'll be
00:56:36 in the mindset that okay i can stop
00:56:38 before so like anything that i do i use
00:56:40 numbers to get there i get halfway and
00:56:42 then i push the goal further
00:56:43 every single time no matter what
00:56:46 which is so it's a mathematical system
00:56:48 ironically so you're
00:56:49 you're you don't necessarily have any
00:56:51 sort of meditative techniques you're
00:56:53 just concentrating on the numbers
00:56:54 meditation for breath holding all the
00:56:56 time right every time i do a breath
00:56:59 now the ice was kind of like there was
00:57:01 like a breathing thing and i didn't
00:57:02 really know much about it back then but
00:57:04 i was like more like fighting it like
00:57:06 what is it like on your ankles or your
00:57:08 knees and your back everything swells up
00:57:10 like edema really bad and all that stuff
00:57:12 and the pain is excruciating and
00:57:13 unbearable but yeah it's
00:57:15 i mean you're waiting and you didn't
00:57:17 have any residual
00:57:18 effects of that just my ankles and legs
00:57:21 were really small just for a few days
00:57:23 or so longer than that but yeah yeah
00:57:26 now has anybody ever tried to break that
00:57:29 uh
00:57:30 i don't know i hope not not because i
00:57:31 want i don't care about how i just don't
00:57:33 want anybody hurt themselves
00:57:34 but i would imagine like someone does
00:57:36 something so high profile like you did
00:57:37 that
00:57:38 that people be like i'm gonna try that i
00:57:41 mean i think it's too weird so people
00:57:43 aren't really like oh i want to do that
00:57:44 but there's billions of people i would
00:57:46 imagine that someone would step in and
00:57:48 try to
00:57:48 emulate that obviously it was saying i
00:57:50 pray not and that's why i pray my
00:57:52 daughter never becomes a magician even
00:57:54 though she's so amazing at it because if
00:57:56 she started doing
00:57:57 these things i like if she's gonna bump
00:57:59 her knee up like i have a heart attack
00:58:01 you know
00:58:01 well that's the problem with being a
00:58:03 parent right yeah
00:58:04 the things that make you amazing are
00:58:07 your ability to overcome adversity and
00:58:09 then you shelter your children from
00:58:10 adversity
00:58:11 you know it's all my favorite people are
00:58:14 all
00:58:14 they all came from a very tumultuous
00:58:17 childhood
00:58:18 they all came from like turmoil and no
00:58:20 one wants that for their child you want
00:58:22 to protect your children yeah
00:58:23 weird it's very weird so what other ones
00:58:26 have you done
00:58:27 where like while you were doing it
00:58:31 you were thinking what the fuck have i
00:58:34 done
00:58:40 because you're committed there was one
00:58:42 that don't
00:58:43 don't pull this one up don't pull this
00:58:45 one
00:58:46 it was called the dive of death and i
00:58:49 started to get cocky i'd done like the
00:58:51 thing in london i'd done like the water
00:58:53 tank i'd done
00:58:54 so i started to get too cocky right i
00:58:57 didn't have time and abc won the show
00:58:59 really quick
00:59:00 i was like okay i'm going to go upside
00:59:01 down for 60 hours three days
00:59:04 whatever right i was gonna be upside
00:59:06 down and then um
00:59:07 and then i some guy was in a parachute
00:59:10 upside down on a tree in italy and he
00:59:12 was in the hospital because he was three
00:59:13 days upside down in the tree
00:59:15 and i was trying to speak to him but he
00:59:17 was like not
00:59:18 he didn't want to talk at all and then
00:59:20 they were like it's his situation's
00:59:22 really bad so it kind of like set the
00:59:23 tone before i did the thing the
00:59:24 situation's really bad like that from
00:59:26 being upside down for that long
00:59:28 what happened to him i i think he's the
00:59:30 blood i think it
00:59:31 i think it does i i don't know because
00:59:33 he didn't i didn't get to
00:59:35 ask they wouldn't tell me but he
00:59:37 wouldn't also engage in a
00:59:39 it was bad that i know it was like in
00:59:41 the news it was bad
00:59:43 um i don't know what the permanent
00:59:45 repercussion
00:59:46 but so when i did this thing upside down
00:59:48 in new york i didn't
00:59:49 practice it i thought i could just wing
00:59:51 it my stunt guy who
00:59:53 taught me to jump off the pole he's like
00:59:54 you can never ever
00:59:56 just go wing something and not dial it
00:59:58 in and rehearse and figure it out you
01:00:00 can't just go do it
01:00:01 it's a you'll you can't hope for luck
01:00:03 and that was the first one ever
01:00:05 and last one that i was like okay let me
01:00:07 just hope that i can do this
01:00:09 as soon as i went upside down remember i
01:00:10 said you could never prepare for certain
01:00:12 things
01:00:13 yeah i had that catheter hooked up and
01:00:14 the first time i peed it just went
01:00:16 upside down all over me so this way and
01:00:19 i was like i'm done
01:00:20 so the whole stunt went down over there
01:00:22 that was like
01:00:23 that was a great learning lesson because
01:00:25 i learned you never just dial it though
01:00:27 did you make it through that one yes but
01:00:29 it was terrible it was
01:00:31 a garbage stunt yes but you were asking
01:00:33 me like what things
01:00:34 so that was one that was like oh yeah
01:00:36 you're but all the others
01:00:38 they were amazing the team that working
01:00:40 with the best people
01:00:41 all of it and this one is the most
01:00:43 amazing like i have a team
01:00:46 that's the one you're doing right now i
01:00:48 have the most
01:00:49 amazing i've never been able to have a
01:00:51 team like this
01:00:52 ever balloon one yes okay explain this
01:00:55 okay so i went to youtube with crazy
01:00:57 idea
01:00:58 who by the way this is youtube and
01:00:59 they've been a blessing
01:01:01 beyond beyond so i'm like okay here's
01:01:04 what i want to do like i want to
01:01:06 grab a bunch of balloons and go floating
01:01:07 up into the sky and disappear like okay
01:01:09 great
01:01:10 okay sure right but so now i need it to
01:01:12 ascend
01:01:13 this is all hypothetical i'm not like a
01:01:15 skydiver like that has a thousand or ten
01:01:17 thousand or twenty thousand jumps
01:01:19 i'm not a balloon pilot i have no
01:01:20 experience in any of this stuff i just
01:01:22 know that i want to do this and i've
01:01:23 wanted to do it forever but i
01:01:25 i had drawings of it made 15 years ago
01:01:29 but now you have to get for real so
01:01:32 there is a guy that flies balloons and
01:01:34 there's a guy like
01:01:35 lawn chair larry that went up on
01:01:36 balloons with like a lawn chair and a
01:01:38 bunch of beer that was his ballast and
01:01:39 he like popped balloons with a gun
01:01:41 so there are examples so it's not like a
01:01:45 complete hypothetical this one has like
01:01:47 okay so what if i could take
01:01:49 the balloons that idea and just have the
01:01:51 innocent image of a kid like we all
01:01:53 dream of just holding the balloons and
01:01:55 drifting
01:01:56 up and into the sky here i'll show you a
01:01:58 picture
01:02:00 what's that what's that one from their
01:02:03 website
01:02:04 from whose website is that jamie balloon
01:02:06 company
01:02:08 right so that's that's my balloon
01:02:11 is that you up there yeah we yeah we did
01:02:14 um
01:02:14 we did short flights not big in public
01:02:16 we kept it small
01:02:18 can i show these to jamie
01:02:21 no i don't know yeah
01:02:24 to him and i can show you sean can you
01:02:27 show it i feel like
01:02:27 i'm not sure all right then don't wait
01:02:29 that's my balloons yeah
01:02:31 oh well that's on but that yeah that's
01:02:33 the end of it i'm doing it yeah it's
01:02:34 just
01:02:35 right so this is but i i i i think maybe
01:02:38 maybe not
01:02:39 because but anyway so so okay so it
01:02:43 starts with just the idea of that
01:02:45 but now i have to go get a hot air
01:02:47 balloon pilot license
01:02:49 so i go meet with the best hot air
01:02:51 balloon pilot
01:02:52 instructor and also flyer but isn't that
01:02:55 the different situation than a hot air
01:02:56 balloon because you don't have the
01:02:57 ability to control
01:02:59 you have to first get your hot air
01:03:00 balloon pilot license so you have to
01:03:02 learn how to fly and land the bloom
01:03:03 which is amazing
01:03:04 right it's like so app and then you have
01:03:06 to take that written test and i don't
01:03:08 have time because i'm trying to do so
01:03:09 much
01:03:10 so i had to cram study the whole written
01:03:12 test in eight hours
01:03:14 with a guy helping me i studied the
01:03:16 whole thing went to the airport took the
01:03:18 test got that
01:03:19 then you need to go get your gas
01:03:21 restriction lifted which means because
01:03:23 and very few people even ever bothered
01:03:25 to do this because who's flying hydrogen
01:03:26 or helium nowadays
01:03:28 so i went and met this guy bert pidelt
01:03:30 who's the best gas balloonist in the
01:03:32 world he's the one that built around the
01:03:34 world in 80 days he's built every
01:03:36 balloon that's done the longest fights
01:03:37 and you fly
01:03:38 now a hot air balloon you're like
01:03:41 right you have to control it and it's
01:03:44 helium and hydrogen
01:03:46 you're just part of the wind you're
01:03:48 literally just
01:03:50 floating away and it'll keep going up to
01:03:53 84
01:03:53 000 feet until they pop there like you
01:03:56 are just floating
01:03:57 like i can't explain that
01:04:00 feeling of floating anyway so i had to
01:04:03 go learn how to fly and land hydrogen
01:04:04 balloons and
01:04:06 use hydrogen because helium is more
01:04:08 expensive and stuff like that
01:04:10 now we have to go test the whole rig
01:04:13 so now and and at the same time i have
01:04:16 to also try to get as close to 500 jumps
01:04:18 out of an airplane because i need to be
01:04:19 really comfortable in the air
01:04:21 if i have to jump out and land i need to
01:04:23 land safely
01:04:24 right and when you're up at 25 plus
01:04:26 thousand feet you don't know where you
01:04:28 are
01:04:28 right so yeah so now and
01:04:32 by the way the video did you see the
01:04:34 video i made for you you didn't see it
01:04:36 no you made a video for me yeah because
01:04:38 when you did the thing with post
01:04:40 and and you in post was like he's not
01:04:41 real and you were defending me i was
01:04:43 like
01:04:43 um hold on i made a video i sent it to
01:04:47 matt i texted him i didn't get a video
01:04:50 he didn't show you
01:04:50 the video no hold on i made you this
01:04:53 video so this is me yelling from the
01:04:55 plane and by the way
01:04:56 this is after the wingsuit guys jump out
01:04:58 of the airplane so remember i'm also
01:05:01 crushing lots of jumps really fast this
01:05:04 one i ran into a fence and almost killed
01:05:05 myself and
01:05:06 the luke who's the best in the world
01:05:08 that has 25 000 more
01:05:10 jumps jumped from 25 000 feet without a
01:05:13 parachute and landed in a net
01:05:14 i saw that yeah so he's the guy coaching
01:05:17 me so he's the one
01:05:18 filming this and he landed at the state
01:05:20 troopers patrol thing because we were so
01:05:22 far
01:05:23 lost and i ended up trying to make it
01:05:25 back
01:05:26 almost hitting the trees really really
01:05:28 close and then crashing into a fence my
01:05:30 legs were all
01:05:31 bloodied up rip through the thing
01:05:33 flipped over landed i was fine that was
01:05:34 recent i was like
01:05:36 and the reason why is because i was
01:05:37 making you this video a complete truth
01:05:40 but i'm gonna explain it to you so to
01:05:41 make the video i had to wait till the
01:05:44 wing suits were out of the plane because
01:05:45 they're last right
01:05:47 but that means and by the way the
01:05:48 conditions you'll see what they were
01:05:50 like in a second
01:05:51 so the plane's moving really really far
01:05:53 away right because it's
01:05:55 still going that means the drop zone is
01:05:57 way over there
01:05:58 and i made the video and it was longer
01:06:00 than i said it was going to be and then
01:06:02 when we
01:06:02 jump we're like lost in the clouds and i
01:06:04 see the only hole
01:06:05 so i fly through the hole and now
01:06:07 because i flew through that hole
01:06:09 we're so far away from everything and i
01:06:13 should have followed luke and went to
01:06:14 the state patrol thing but i was like no
01:06:16 i'm going to make it just back
01:06:17 and but so here's the video i gave you
01:06:19 though
01:06:20 can we play it for other people yeah
01:06:22 okay why don't you air drop it to jamie
01:06:24 oh yeah
01:06:26 okay hold on so let me uh
01:06:32 isn't that funny though it's pretty wild
01:06:35 but you don't bumped out that i didn't
01:06:37 get this before oh
01:06:39 well yeah so i was going to like
01:06:42 post it or something i asked him if i
01:06:44 should and he's like well wait because
01:06:45 maybe he'll just do the show
01:06:47 so i think that's why he didn't maybe or
01:06:49 something
01:06:51 like i don't why i don't know hold on
01:06:54 maybe it got lost in the email or
01:06:55 something it might have gotten to one of
01:06:57 those
01:06:58 that the email dumps get pretty big
01:07:01 sometimes
01:07:02 the point where i can't keep up is it
01:07:03 young james
01:07:05 young jamie young james
01:07:10 okay so that's that one but then i'm
01:07:11 gonna show you the rest of the shop but
01:07:13 you might have to scroll through it to
01:07:14 get to it but
01:07:15 um i'll show you but by the way it's the
01:07:18 most amazing
01:07:19 so i'll show you the rest of that shot
01:07:21 and then you'll see where he landed and
01:07:23 where i landed so
01:07:24 i'm going to send you first the pretty
01:07:26 version of it you guys can like
01:07:28 cut through or whatever sure okay yeah
01:07:31 so i'm gonna edit i'm gonna just send
01:07:32 you like the full
01:07:34 and then go look through so
01:07:37 here's another one
01:07:41 when is this one supposed to be in two
01:07:43 weeks in two weeks
01:07:44 yeah and do you have to take into
01:07:46 consideration the wind
01:07:48 the like what with the current oh yeah
01:07:51 temperature
01:07:51 and that's why we can't like confirm a
01:07:53 location because winds determine
01:07:55 everything
01:07:56 so even though now i'm at like you know
01:07:58 almost
01:07:59 400 jumps the winds still decide where
01:08:02 you go
01:08:03 oh here so all right here we go
01:08:06 did you get that other one i i've only
01:08:08 got one okay i'm just gonna make sure
01:08:09 this is what you want me to play
01:08:10 all right well that's the first one so
01:08:12 we i can do this airdrop come back
01:08:14 sure okay okay check this
01:08:23 a little bit out it watch my last
01:08:25 youtube video
01:08:27 the show i hope to come show you in
01:08:29 person
01:08:30 because that might actually save my life
01:08:37 oh jesus christ okay but so you see the
01:08:39 clouds
01:08:40 now hold on this one's going to come so
01:08:42 you're hanging on to a plane how high
01:08:44 are you there
01:08:45 no that was just i don't know like 13
01:08:47 000. oh nothing
01:08:49 no but i went to speak no but i went to
01:08:53 yeah yeah but still you're still 13 000
01:08:56 feet off the air
01:08:56 hanging onto a plane and you jump off
01:08:59 maybe it's another one maybe it's this
01:09:00 one
01:09:02 it's hilarious that you're like oh it's
01:09:03 only 13 000 feet
01:09:05 hanging onto the wing of a plane and
01:09:07 then i let go on video
01:09:11 i know but you need to see i can i can't
01:09:14 play it here though right and show you
01:09:15 like this we have to air drop it because
01:09:16 it's going to air drop is better because
01:09:18 it's going
01:09:19 well i just want to send this one that
01:09:21 shows like how spectacular but i could
01:09:23 just say that
01:09:25 which explains what's going on so hold
01:09:27 on no which one because there's three
01:09:29 young james
01:09:30 uh the macbook pro jamie but there's
01:09:32 three
01:09:33 mvp doesn't matter it's click one and it
01:09:35 should work
01:09:36 now when you decide to do something like
01:09:39 this do you get an inspiration
01:09:41 and then you consult people to see if
01:09:43 it's feasible
01:09:45 like well so that's where i was lucky so
01:09:48 what i was saying is i come up with the
01:09:49 idea
01:09:50 and then i find a guy his name is
01:09:52 jonathan trapp he's the one that tried
01:09:53 to cross the atlantic with healing for
01:09:55 balloons
01:09:56 and but i mean he has it's like a full
01:09:58 system he has a basket so it's like a
01:10:00 real
01:10:01 balloon like a hot air balloon system
01:10:02 with so nobody's
01:10:04 ever done it where they just float where
01:10:06 their bodies are
01:10:07 the basket you know what i mean so he
01:10:10 had the whole system and then he came
01:10:11 and tested out and i was like could i go
01:10:12 try it like this and he's like no we're
01:10:14 not
01:10:15 ready you'll kill yourself or whatever
01:10:17 you're hanging on to the rope
01:10:18 yeah but i'm gonna make sure that i'm
01:10:20 not gonna have a parachute on and i'm
01:10:22 gonna
01:10:22 i'll i'll have a system so i'm
01:10:24 completely secure so i'm not gonna fall
01:10:26 off
01:10:26 but i'm not gonna wear the parachute
01:10:28 because i don't want to be
01:10:30 i want it to look like a kid just
01:10:32 holding on to balloons so like that
01:10:34 visual is the important part
01:10:35 so the parachutes up in the balloons but
01:10:38 once i get above
01:10:39 like uh a thousand feet or so i'm gonna
01:10:42 put the parachute on
01:10:45 so you're going to put the parachute on
01:10:46 while you're up there yeah and then i
01:10:48 want to see if how
01:10:49 high i can go you see
01:10:54 how do you think you can go well
01:10:57 so the highest thing on earth is mount
01:11:00 everest
01:11:01 right so that's kind of my
01:11:04 goal but i have to be careful because if
01:11:06 you
01:11:07 if you're if you don't come back down
01:11:09 you're dead so if you can't get down
01:11:11 from there that's
01:11:13 that zone is like the death zone so from
01:11:15 like 25
01:11:16 000 to 30 000 is very very dangerous you
01:11:20 can black out like this so
01:11:22 i'm gonna do a couple more hypoxic tests
01:11:24 and see if i'm right
01:11:25 i'll have emergency stuff up there like
01:11:27 oxygen if i need it
01:11:28 but i don't want to floating around with
01:11:30 you up there in the balloons yeah we
01:11:32 have like the
01:11:34 the way it's not dude your loved ones
01:11:37 panic when you start
01:11:39 plotting things like this my daughter
01:11:41 asks questions how old is she
01:11:43 nine and she asks great questions and um
01:11:46 the the plate the
01:11:47 tail number the plate is for me and her
01:11:48 so it's n for number but
01:11:50 nine for her age 47 for my age and then
01:11:53 db for me and her were both desa and
01:11:55 david blaine
01:11:56 but um which is the balloon that has
01:11:59 i made this has to be a registered
01:12:01 aircraft so we had to get it registered
01:12:03 we had to fly it up we had to prove that
01:12:05 it's completely safe we had to land it
01:12:07 with nobody on it so the body
01:12:10 one time that i went wasn't me it was
01:12:12 sand that weighed exactly what i weighed
01:12:14 we had to remote dump the sand we had to
01:12:17 use squibs to remote pop the balloons
01:12:19 fly it over and this is it twenty two
01:12:22 thousand feet
01:12:23 what is what is control possibly but is
01:12:25 it radio yeah yeah yeah exactly okay and
01:12:27 i i
01:12:28 have the whole team helping me that did
01:12:29 like alan used this when he jumped and
01:12:31 felix baumgartner when he jumped from
01:12:32 the edge of space so we have
01:12:34 don day the best meteorologist do they
01:12:36 have to weigh you
01:12:37 before you get on yeah it's precision
01:12:41 and then so we had to fly it all the way
01:12:43 up to 22 000 feet as proof that this
01:12:45 aircraft is actually
01:12:47 completely doable and then remote it
01:12:49 exactly where donde predicted we were
01:12:52 going to land it and we've done that
01:12:53 multiple times
01:12:54 we've flown it we've deployed the the
01:12:57 imitation
01:12:58 massive amount of time involved in
01:13:01 constructing one of these things and
01:13:02 orchestrating it
01:13:04 time and team and team is everything
01:13:08 so it'd be like you when you have like
01:13:10 the best trainers if you had like
01:13:12 your five best in the world like
01:13:15 tweaking you before fights like that
01:13:18 so when when you plan on doing something
01:13:20 like this did you bring this up
01:13:22 to to these folks these are the first
01:13:24 people the people you're doing it with
01:13:26 these are the people you brought it up
01:13:27 to the first time yeah nobody said get
01:13:28 the fuck out of here with this nope
01:13:30 went straight to youtube and i was like
01:13:32 i have this he went through these guys
01:13:33 and
01:13:34 did they hesitate at all no they're
01:13:36 they're amazing
01:13:37 that that's crazy right it is all so
01:13:41 crazy
01:13:41 because it is just a hypothetical idea
01:13:43 that's insane that's
01:13:44 true and they did let me like but there
01:13:46 were stages i had to prove each step so
01:13:48 i had to prove that number one
01:13:50 the balloon is doable number two i'm not
01:13:53 gonna hopefully kill myself number three
01:13:55 i can actually get the
01:13:56 oh and then for the skydives by the way
01:13:58 because i had to get 500 jumps really
01:14:00 quick and this is all during the last
01:14:02 year right um so insurance wouldn't
01:14:05 cover that i mean they would cover but
01:14:07 it's not affordable so i had to do five
01:14:09 almost 500 400 jumps or so with no
01:14:12 insurance and so that's a whole separate
01:14:15 thing that's not related so i had to go
01:14:16 do them for my own
01:14:18 as fun and do everything through my own
01:14:22 you see so it's crazy it's all nuts
01:14:24 because
01:14:25 because you think of skydiving think
01:14:26 like oh you have the best coach it's
01:14:28 fine but there's still
01:14:29 like when you're trying to do 15 jumps a
01:14:31 day it's like
01:14:32 you can do what i did which is try to
01:14:35 avoid hitting an airplane in a hangar
01:14:37 and turn too low
01:14:38 and come whacking down when did you come
01:14:40 up with this idea
01:14:42 uh i mean i think it was like inspired
01:14:44 when i was a kid i think like the idea
01:14:46 of like the little boy drifting around
01:14:48 balloons
01:14:49 i think it was like but i never really
01:14:51 thought of it as a reality but then
01:14:54 15 years ago or so i had drawings made
01:14:56 of it so i started having
01:14:57 i'll show you the drawings i can't open
01:14:59 it on there or whatever so when did you
01:15:00 put it into motion
01:15:02 um like it was never even possible until
01:15:05 youtube said okay we'll back this
01:15:06 because the idea is like all of my other
01:15:08 stunts there's like
01:15:09 the budget's pretty very you know
01:15:12 not you couldn't afford to do something
01:15:14 like this this is to build test a flight
01:15:16 build an actual aircraft fly it land it
01:15:19 get all the jumps learn how to do
01:15:21 everything get all the skill set having
01:15:23 so this is but that's the first drawing
01:15:26 oh wow yeah so you drew this when you
01:15:29 were
01:15:30 i didn't draw it oh someone else did
01:15:32 yeah mark stutzman who's an amazing
01:15:33 artist that did my poster for this thing
01:15:35 which i'll show you so
01:15:36 can i send this to jamie yeah it's not
01:15:38 working but you can try
01:15:39 airdrop's not working uh i noticed
01:15:41 something weird was happening when he's
01:15:42 trying to do it
01:15:43 i can but maybe the picture will go
01:15:47 if not i can restart the phone and maybe
01:15:48 it'll work
01:15:52 was it showing up for you jamie no right
01:15:55 let me restart the phone there's a lot
01:15:56 of uh
01:15:57 okay now it says it's waiting
01:16:01 there's like so many macbook pros you
01:16:02 got it yeah there's three oh when
01:16:04 yeah someone went through okay then i'll
01:16:06 also send oh but wait so should i also
01:16:08 show you the poster that i had made
01:16:10 okay um
01:16:13 so you you come to youtube powerful
01:16:16 youtube
01:16:16 they come up with the side i mean they
01:16:18 agree with
01:16:20 that's the original but this is the
01:16:22 latest one so
01:16:24 did you send that one to him too yeah
01:16:28 i'll send it to you jamie
01:16:32 it's coming through right now supposedly
01:16:34 i think it's like i have to accept them
01:16:36 for some reason
01:16:37 it doesn't just go is it showing up for
01:16:40 you
01:16:41 no i think i should restart the phone
01:16:43 because those videos too i want to send
01:16:46 there goes okay how did you get it to go
01:16:48 though which one did you press
01:16:49 i don't know there's so many of them
01:16:51 doesn't make any sense
01:16:53 your phone is being monitored by the
01:16:55 government they're cloning
01:16:57 hold on i want to try to send this video
01:16:59 so i could explain making your video if
01:17:01 that's possible
01:17:07 but then when you oh now it's preparing
01:17:09 it so now okay
01:17:10 beautiful now it's going through you
01:17:12 have it coming
01:17:13 right now because it says it's
01:17:16 converting so it might be coming
01:17:17 we're waiting for an accept on this so
01:17:20 okay
01:17:21 as soon as i get that so you bring this
01:17:24 to youtube
01:17:25 and how long ago was it uh
01:17:28 like a year and a half ago or something
01:17:30 like that they say yeah
01:17:31 let's do it we're fucking crazy yeah
01:17:34 and also it's probably going to have 100
01:17:37 million people watch it so it seems like
01:17:38 i don't know i don't know about that oh
01:17:40 i do yeah i don't know i'm gonna float
01:17:42 around in a
01:17:44 [Laughter]
01:17:49 but this one by far is my favorite that
01:17:52 i've ever done it's the most
01:17:54 visual the most colorful it's the first
01:17:56 one that i've ever done
01:17:58 where my friends are like i want to do
01:17:59 that right they're not like
01:18:01 why do you do that you're holding on but
01:18:04 you know all the other since i do people
01:18:05 are like
01:18:06 like that's it's great that you're doing
01:18:08 it but that's crazy or why are you doing
01:18:10 it
01:18:10 this one they're like i want to ride the
01:18:12 balloons
01:18:14 because it's such a childhood yeah
01:18:17 they're they're yeah like this so it'll
01:18:18 be like that
01:18:19 wow that's pretty cool so it'll look
01:18:21 just like that
01:18:22 how is it are you harnessed it's like a
01:18:25 yeah it'll be like
01:18:26 a little thing that connects at my wrist
01:18:27 which like the way the
01:18:29 um aerialists have a connection
01:18:31 connected to your body your torso
01:18:33 somehow yeah it'll be connected
01:18:35 somewhere crotch
01:18:37 yeah hopefully like a nightmare
01:18:39 something yeah because when you get up
01:18:40 to like
01:18:41 minus you know 20 degrees or whatever
01:18:44 you
01:18:45 you'll be non-functional up there so
01:18:46 right you can't just rely
01:18:48 well you can't really rely on your hand
01:18:50 no i could no no
01:18:51 no no i was practic if i had to do this
01:18:53 up to like
01:18:54 you know two to three thousand feet i
01:18:56 could because holding on yeah
01:18:58 yeah you can a sand you can also do what
01:19:00 you know just put something around your
01:19:02 foot like the
01:19:02 the wires could come down okay so
01:19:04 something around your foot would just be
01:19:05 so just it takes
01:19:12 like i mean it's really hard to hang for
01:19:15 more than a couple of minutes
01:19:16 it's hard to hang for more than a minute
01:19:18 i think like the record is like two
01:19:19 minutes but
01:19:20 what with one second yeah with one hand
01:19:23 okay but this has to look
01:19:24 the whole that this has to look like the
01:19:26 one-handed advantage of the person
01:19:28 flying
01:19:28 it has to be exact so right you'd have
01:19:30 to have some freaky forearms
01:19:32 popeye yeah so i'll have assistance
01:19:34 built but
01:19:35 so i won't have a parachute or any of
01:19:37 that stuff that'll be above me so it'll
01:19:39 look really clean but i'll be
01:19:40 supported now if there's a balloon
01:19:43 failure or something like that
01:19:45 obviously i'm in trouble um obviously
01:19:48 but once i get the parachute on once i
01:19:50 get to 5 000
01:19:51 feet then we know okay he's not going to
01:19:54 die he has a parachute on
01:19:55 i can get away and now the big challenge
01:19:58 is how high can you go
01:20:01 so once you get how are you going to
01:20:03 know do you have an altimeter
01:20:04 on the i'll have an altimeter but i'm
01:20:07 also going to have a
01:20:08 communication okay full everything okay
01:20:11 i'm going to have cameras with me
01:20:13 are you using a watch for the altimeter
01:20:15 or like what are you using
01:20:17 i'm using this one called the kunu right
01:20:18 now but it's big sure no but i was
01:20:20 i've been jumping with suntoes and
01:20:22 things just to check
01:20:24 how accurate they are and they're not
01:20:25 bad they're like off by like 200 feet
01:20:28 or something like that but on the
01:20:30 landing you don't want to be off
01:20:31 you know especially if you're like me
01:20:33 you don't even you only have 400 jumps
01:20:35 not even right right so and you're
01:20:37 landing in dicey areas because you don't
01:20:39 know where you are
01:20:40 right so gust of wind can throw you here
01:20:43 or there
01:20:43 yeah anything but you also have to like
01:20:45 not hit a power line or a building or an
01:20:47 obstacle or anything wherever you are
01:20:49 right if you if you come down into a
01:20:51 mountain you're going to whack into that
01:20:52 it looks flat from here but if you
01:20:54 didn't adjust you're going to come in
01:20:55 hard and that's it you'll eat it right
01:20:57 if you hit a power line you're dead so
01:20:59 yeah those types of things we have to
01:21:01 like
01:21:02 and which is why when i'm controlling
01:21:05 the balloons and going up and up and up
01:21:06 and up and up
01:21:08 um i'm gonna
01:21:11 hopefully be fine hopefully you're
01:21:14 scaring the shit out of me already
01:21:16 so at 5000 feet you how do you get the
01:21:18 parachute
01:21:19 um it's up there and the balloons and
01:21:21 i'm going to pull it down
01:21:22 it's on like a fishing wire thing i pull
01:21:24 it down
01:21:25 and then i put it on that's the only
01:21:27 like really difficult thing as well
01:21:29 have you done this already you've
01:21:30 practiced that aspect i've practiced it
01:21:32 and that's like
01:21:33 really scary to everybody around oh like
01:21:35 they they're asking me why won't i just
01:21:37 wear the thing like everybody
01:21:38 yeah they're like you have to wear it
01:21:42 and you don't want to wear it and my
01:21:43 brother's really obsessed with it my
01:21:45 daughter's new question is how come
01:21:46 you're not wearing the parachute but um
01:21:48 but i'm telling her it's
01:21:49 fine but you haven't
01:21:52 have you done this transition yet where
01:21:54 you go from floating to putting the
01:21:55 parachute on
01:21:57 no that'll be done live the first time
01:21:59 oh
01:22:00 jesus this whole thing will be done the
01:22:02 first time live and i've never done it
01:22:03 in completion i've done all the elements
01:22:05 of it
01:22:06 so i've done the jumps i've done the
01:22:08 balloon flights i've flown the rig but
01:22:10 i've never put it all together that's
01:22:11 all going to happen for the first time
01:22:14 live on youtube
01:22:18 and so once you get the the vest on once
01:22:20 you get the
01:22:21 the parachute on then the goal is to see
01:22:24 how high you can get on yeah and once
01:22:25 that's the part that i'm obsessed with
01:22:27 when you get to the area of 30 000 plus
01:22:29 feet no no you can't cross there
01:22:31 i mean i i just want to get the goal is
01:22:33 i if i get up to like
01:22:36 25 000 feet i'm i'm excited okay
01:22:39 because that's where the ice i want to
01:22:40 disappear like i actually want the
01:22:42 visual to be that i disappear into the
01:22:44 sky
01:22:47 okay so you get up to 25. i'm not going
01:22:49 to kill myself
01:22:50 doing it hope not i won't okay i believe
01:22:53 but this one is
01:22:54 different than i'm gonna have the o2
01:22:56 things by the way you can't send the o2
01:22:58 pulse oximeter signals down so they
01:23:00 won't know if i'm hypoxic but i'm going
01:23:02 to have the o2 monitors in my pocket
01:23:04 i'm going to put them on i'm going to
01:23:05 show them to the camera they can still
01:23:07 communicate with you
01:23:08 yeah now if they can't that's a big
01:23:10 issue so if communication fails then
01:23:12 this is
01:23:13 for me communication is done through
01:23:15 what uh
01:23:17 rf this this incredible guy that builds
01:23:19 all of the communication for every
01:23:21 skydiving stunt movie so he's the same
01:23:24 way that a plane can communicate with
01:23:25 the ground
01:23:27 yeah yeah it's something yeah and i have
01:23:30 i have a transponder up here i have
01:23:31 everything so the planes
01:23:33 i'm visible everybody knows where i am
01:23:35 okay we're clearing everything with the
01:23:37 fa the atc
01:23:38 so everything is going to be you know
01:23:40 completely organized as it needs to be
01:23:42 we have a wind path in every location
01:23:44 that we're going to possibly do this in
01:23:46 of course new york is a dream and
01:23:48 there's some other dreams that we have
01:23:49 so
01:23:50 you know this is still we have a couple
01:23:52 of key points that we're
01:23:54 dreaming about doing this and uh
01:23:56 depending on wind and weather that's
01:23:58 where we'll do it and how do you get
01:23:59 how do you descend um
01:24:03 just let go of some you're just gonna
01:24:05 just completely just release myself yeah
01:24:07 so you're gonna skydive at 25 000 feet
01:24:09 yeah by the way when i did that when i
01:24:12 did the i told you when i did that uh
01:24:14 test when i went up to 20 almost 20 24 7
01:24:17 or whatever
01:24:18 i had the uh the helmet on the first
01:24:20 breath i took the entire thing was ice
01:24:22 right away so and i was flying down
01:24:24 looking through like a little hole
01:24:26 in the helmet yeah i couldn't see
01:24:30 jesus christ and so
01:24:34 when you land you have to land i mean
01:24:37 you're
01:24:38 from 25 000 feet you have to make sure
01:24:39 that you're conscious
01:24:41 you have to make sure that you can see
01:24:42 that's right but usually by the way even
01:24:44 if you are hypoxic
01:24:46 and you're dropping you clear up at like
01:24:49 ten thousand feet
01:24:50 so luke aikens the who you watch he did
01:24:53 a jump once
01:24:54 where he was jumping with felix
01:24:56 baumgarten who he trained
01:24:58 and he was um out of he was hypoxic he
01:25:01 was blacked out
01:25:02 but when he got to about 9000 feet or so
01:25:04 he woke up
01:25:05 and then from yeah but from 9000 feet
01:25:08 down you have you know 40 seconds to
01:25:10 figure out where you are and what you're
01:25:11 doing
01:25:12 okay
01:25:16 it still seems fucking terrifying um
01:25:20 and so then you're you're floating down
01:25:22 and
01:25:23 you have to find a good spot to land and
01:25:26 when are you going to do this like
01:25:27 what's the the official launch date is
01:25:29 it
01:25:29 august 31 100 depending on winds
01:25:32 depending on when so if the winds are
01:25:33 fucked on august 31st yeah
01:25:35 exactly and that's the other thing
01:25:36 youtube's been amazing on there it is
01:25:38 david blaine
01:25:39 ascension youtube originals august 31st
01:25:42 yeah that's basically what it is i love
01:25:44 that youtube stepped up to do this
01:25:45 but yeah it is amazing it is amazing
01:25:48 look at you floating above the cloud in
01:25:50 that image and that's
01:25:50 literally what you're going to be doing
01:25:52 yeah that's so fucked
01:25:55 but also the thing about this one aside
01:25:57 from like the the technical part of it
01:25:59 is like
01:26:01 the visual on it so far is my favorite
01:26:04 one
01:26:04 yeah it's like up like when they did it
01:26:07 but when i look at the balloons i become
01:26:09 like giddy like and all these adults are
01:26:11 working we're all like laughing because
01:26:12 we're like little we're like
01:26:14 kids playing with balloon you know it's
01:26:16 like it's iconic it's something that
01:26:18 every kid has kind of thought of yeah
01:26:20 yeah grabbing a balloon and flying
01:26:23 like mary poppins yeah yeah yeah wow man
01:26:26 and that was my daughter's nickname when
01:26:28 she was growing up but we called uh
01:26:30 mary the real mary poppins if she was a
01:26:32 real very popular we'd put a balloon up
01:26:34 and we'd always watch it and dream and
01:26:36 talk about where it goes and stuff like
01:26:38 that
01:26:39 what is it like for her to when you
01:26:41 discuss things these things she's
01:26:43 so amazing i run ideas by her she's
01:26:45 amazing
01:26:46 yeah she's amazing by the way the reason
01:26:48 there's pink balloons in this one is
01:26:50 because i was showing her all the
01:26:51 balloons and she went is there going to
01:26:52 be pink
01:26:52 and i was like of course there's going
01:26:54 to be fake good now there's fake yeah
01:26:56 that's the lens wow
01:26:59 now you have you been doing live shows
01:27:01 this whole time or
01:27:02 are you are you able to with cope not
01:27:04 during covet no but
01:27:05 right up to code i was doing live and
01:27:07 that i i haven't been promoting
01:27:09 or anything but it's like my favorite
01:27:11 thing because i've been working on the
01:27:12 live
01:27:12 show for 20 some years and i've never
01:27:16 done one until
01:27:18 like the last few years like started
01:27:20 like
01:27:21 three years ago the first time i didn't
01:27:23 i which is crazy
01:27:25 right because yeah but i finally
01:27:28 felt like i had the right material to
01:27:30 make a good show
01:27:32 and the show is so it was it's so it's
01:27:35 like i open it with the mouse sewing
01:27:37 so the first thing is like but i bring
01:27:39 people up so it's also comical it's like
01:27:41 funny right like joking around and stuff
01:27:43 that you see people like ah yeah
01:27:44 when you say mouth sewing you actually
01:27:46 sew your mouth shut yeah
01:27:47 yeah and you do that how many nights a
01:27:49 week one uh
01:27:50 no so i so i would do two days on one
01:27:53 day off but every
01:27:54 day of a show means you can't eat for 36
01:27:57 hours before the show because i also
01:27:58 have to
01:27:59 put a gallon of water in my stomach i
01:28:01 have to put a cup of kerosene but now
01:28:03 i don't swallow the kerosene i put it in
01:28:04 my mouth now and spit it so i don't
01:28:06 swallow
01:28:06 but on jimmy uh jimmy kimmel i drank
01:28:09 this stuff and it's like
01:28:10 really really that's how the guy died
01:28:12 how glee that i told you
01:28:14 so now um i just put it in the mouth
01:28:15 spit it but see i and then i do the
01:28:17 frogs in the stomach i put the hanger
01:28:19 all the way down the throat to fetch
01:28:21 somebody's ring
01:28:22 i um i do the breath i do the breath
01:28:26 hold every single night and
01:28:28 um and then and then and then i have
01:28:30 them push an ice pick through my arm
01:28:32 every night
01:28:32 which is like you don't want to hit a
01:28:34 brachial you know anything a nerve
01:28:36 yeah or an artery or anything of course
01:28:39 so but i and i let them choose a spot
01:28:41 by the way i also brought the ice pick
01:28:43 if you do do want to see because i
01:28:45 i know that you know it's real but i
01:28:46 should if oh i believe it's real but i
01:28:48 still
01:28:48 want to see it i haven't done it i
01:28:50 haven't done it since my tour really
01:28:52 yeah are you itching to do it i mean i'd
01:28:54 like you to do it
01:28:56 i'd like you to do just to see that it
01:28:58 is like pretty straightforward
01:28:59 oh i believe it's straightforward but i
01:29:01 brought one with me and i got the
01:29:02 alcohol from them so here is uh
01:29:04 look at that girl poor girl and so
01:29:07 you're stitching
01:29:09 your mouth exactly but so see so what i
01:29:12 was able to do with the stage show is i
01:29:14 bring people up on stage and i have the
01:29:15 cameras with the big screen
01:29:16 so you see people reacting to this stuff
01:29:19 so it's the magic
01:29:20 plus the reaction so you get that whole
01:29:22 and this girl's really into it look at
01:29:23 her
01:29:26 so you you do this all the time
01:29:29 the stitching the mouth shut i would
01:29:30 imagine you would accumulate some scar
01:29:32 tissue no
01:29:33 that one's easy but this one's legit
01:29:34 this one i used to do it through the
01:29:36 hand this is the ice way
01:29:37 this one i used to do through the hand
01:29:39 and i developed so much scar tissue that
01:29:41 like when i move my fingers a certain
01:29:42 way i get a shooting pain so i stopped
01:29:44 doing my hands and i switched to here
01:29:46 that makes sense yeah i would i would
01:29:48 imagine that would really fuck your
01:29:50 hands up
01:29:50 alcohol
01:29:56 so wait but so i might have to sit next
01:29:59 to you or something
01:29:59 do you want me to do this to you is this
01:30:01 what's going on here yeah i can come
01:30:02 over to your side
01:30:03 okay okay okay all right but wait don't
01:30:07 you need the
01:30:07 or you can put those on i'll just come
01:30:09 walk over
01:30:12 so should i take the thing off you can
01:30:15 if you like
01:30:16 we'll both be uh basically talking into
01:30:18 the same mic no but we can do it sitting
01:30:20 yeah but can you put those ones on yeah
01:30:22 okay
01:30:26 this mic work one second okay jamie will
01:30:28 turn this mic on and i'll crank this
01:30:30 thing over to here
01:30:31 okay so you choose the do you want the
01:30:33 left or the right
01:30:34 uh let's do the right since it's right
01:30:36 next to me
01:30:38 okay do you want them to come in and see
01:30:40 it as well no
01:30:41 okay good enough okay so now
01:30:44 this is not a new ice pick and usually i
01:30:47 do it with new ones which means
01:30:49 this isn't as sharp as it needs to be so
01:30:51 it means the push is going to be a
01:30:52 little more
01:30:53 difficult i guess why do you like to do
01:30:55 this you seem to be
01:30:56 or are these ones that you give us at
01:30:58 least pure alcohol yes
01:31:00 yes
01:31:02 i mean they're just the standard ones
01:31:04 that you get that's fine i'm sure
01:31:06 yeah yeah yeah oh you want to make sure
01:31:08 there's no scent in it or anything no no
01:31:10 i want to make sure that there's no
01:31:11 bacteria right but i mean on the alcohol
01:31:13 strip oh yeah exactly yeah um why do you
01:31:17 enjoy this you seem you're you're
01:31:18 excited about this no
01:31:19 well first of all it's amazing that you
01:31:21 can actually do something like this like
01:31:22 it's nothing so there's a guy named
01:31:24 miranda
01:31:25 can you pull up miranda you think so
01:31:28 miranda
01:31:29 it's this guy and nobody believed he was
01:31:31 doing it for real and he would take
01:31:33 rapiers and he would have them push
01:31:35 through
01:31:36 right through the middle of his body
01:31:38 through his lungs and everything he
01:31:40 would show on all sides and then they
01:31:42 would pull him out and he'd be perfectly
01:31:44 fine
01:31:44 he and every every doctor and saying oh
01:31:46 you can't do that but
01:31:47 so remember when steve irwin died do you
01:31:49 know why he died
01:31:51 no because he pulled the stingray thing
01:31:53 out of his heart the stingray
01:31:54 and he pulled it out right crocodile so
01:31:57 if he's
01:31:58 kept it in there he would have lived
01:31:59 right after that a 70 year old man was
01:32:02 on his boat and a stingray jumped up out
01:32:03 of the water
01:32:04 stung him in the heart and then stingray
01:32:07 was gone
01:32:08 but though i didn't even yeah oh my god
01:32:11 look at that
01:32:12 isn't that crazy but the fact that you
01:32:15 can actually do this
01:32:16 is what's crazy like the body can you
01:32:19 with your mind you can override it
01:32:21 and then the thing is he got so cocky
01:32:23 though that he thought he could do
01:32:24 anything
01:32:25 and then he ate one of these things he
01:32:27 swallowed it and he killed him he died
01:32:29 internally and died but see he got
01:32:31 really cocky because he was like i could
01:32:33 do anything that is fucking insane so
01:32:35 he's
01:32:36 is he going through his liver he can go
01:32:38 through anything and that's what i'm
01:32:40 saying so the seven-year-old guy
01:32:42 that got the stingray to it stabbed him
01:32:44 in the heart
01:32:45 instead of pulling it out which it's
01:32:47 like a corkscrew
01:32:48 he waited till they with doctors till it
01:32:51 beat out the other side and he was
01:32:53 fine you see wow
01:32:56 so instead of pulling it out he waited
01:32:59 until what happened
01:33:00 the doctors waited with the heart they
01:33:02 let it beat out the other side and they
01:33:04 slowly let it come out it went through
01:33:06 his whole body
01:33:07 if they would have pulled it it's like a
01:33:08 corkscrew it would rip him apart
01:33:10 he would die how long did it take for it
01:33:13 to beat through no but i know that the
01:33:14 doctors what they did is they let it go
01:33:16 through
01:33:17 [Laughter]
01:33:20 guys
01:33:22 how many times this guy gets stabbed
01:33:23 like i've done that one by the way right
01:33:25 there
01:33:26 that's a safe place that's like not an
01:33:28 issue but when you go through the lungs
01:33:30 and stuff it's crazy
01:33:32 look it's crazy but this is too much i
01:33:34 wouldn't show it it's too like too much
01:33:36 fucking sword man but that's what i'm
01:33:39 saying that one
01:33:40 listen but so what happened
01:33:43 was he started to get too cocky he
01:33:46 started to think he was fine
01:33:48 oh jesus christ
01:33:52 but okay so joe but you have to listen
01:33:54 to the origin of this trick though
01:33:55 that's not a trick no but i know but
01:33:57 listen the origin of this
01:33:59 is as a kid there's that trick where
01:34:01 they do needle through arm
01:34:03 yes right and it's like the rubber you
01:34:05 know the stuff and it sticks your skin
01:34:06 together
01:34:07 it looks perfect it looks like it's
01:34:08 really through your arm and then they
01:34:10 like squeeze blood out of the thing they
01:34:12 so i saw that and then i was like
01:34:15 but maybe that's like actually doable
01:34:18 like maybe that trick could really be
01:34:19 done
01:34:19 so like the same exact trick but for
01:34:22 real
01:34:23 right so that's this okay okay so you
01:34:26 take that
01:34:27 okay like i said it's going to be a
01:34:29 little tricky to push through just
01:34:30 because the
01:34:31 it's usually sharp and this time it's
01:34:33 not as sharp but how do you know where
01:34:35 to do it
01:34:36 we're gonna pick there's no particular
01:34:39 spot
01:34:40 you know you're gonna how do i know i'm
01:34:41 not gonna hit an artery though i don't
01:34:42 know i can't kill you bro
01:34:45 so you want me just right here anywhere
01:34:47 sure what's where do you prefer
01:34:49 wherever you want like right there wow
01:34:51 sure i don't know but
01:34:52 yeah do it there where you want do it
01:34:54 where you want when you say well
01:34:55 sure like where do you like it to go
01:34:58 through the bottom
01:34:59 no i liked where you were going right
01:35:00 like you're you're too i mean that's
01:35:03 that's fine like so you have to go like
01:35:05 through
01:35:06 well what do you want me to do yeah
01:35:07 you're gonna push through okay
01:35:09 so hold on you here yeah keep like a
01:35:11 straight path
01:35:13 okay like that no it goes straight like
01:35:15 that yeah i'd go
01:35:16 straight through yeah okay ready slowly
01:35:19 and go slow
01:35:27 you're lifting my see that yep see
01:35:30 so it's hard to believe that it's real
01:35:33 keep pushing
01:35:34 keep going keep going
01:35:38 wait uh oh hold on
01:35:45 what happened i hit a nerve oh jesus
01:35:49 no no no no no no no come on man you got
01:35:51 to do another spot you were hitting the
01:35:53 nerve
01:35:53 yeah but what if i fucked your arm up
01:35:55 man and then you can't hang from the
01:35:56 balloon and then youtube's mad at me
01:35:58 [Laughter]
01:36:02 okay again jesus bro
01:36:05 okay so by the way honest to god
01:36:08 i'm never go in this direction which way
01:36:10 to go i always go
01:36:12 this direction from inside to out i'm
01:36:15 just saying of like the
01:36:16 of the all the times i did it i've
01:36:17 always gone this direction do you want
01:36:19 me to go that direction
01:36:20 i'm just telling you i've never
01:36:21 experienced that better no so what's the
01:36:23 difference i'm just saying i've never
01:36:24 done it this way oh okay so it's the
01:36:26 groundbreaking
01:36:27 no i'm saying it's nuts well it's
01:36:29 definitely nuts
01:36:30 okay good no but from the bottom like
01:36:33 this like that
01:36:34 yeah and then i go again and i would i
01:36:36 would try to go like a straight path
01:36:38 through like right there
01:36:39 no i would go like lower and in like
01:36:42 just right there
01:36:44 ready yeah okay yeah i'd like that and
01:36:46 keep hold on
01:36:49 wait wait push
01:36:55 yeah like that like that that's good
01:36:59 yep we're on a clean path we hit
01:37:01 something but it's fine
01:37:02 now what i use is this i use the skin
01:37:05 here and i push so you can see it come
01:37:07 through
01:37:07 push that's it see alrighty
01:37:15 super unnecessary but uh but it does
01:37:19 seem like a magic trick like it
01:37:21 definitely doesn't seem like a magic
01:37:22 trick
01:37:22 but hold on there's blood vessels and
01:37:25 everything yeah there's no blood
01:37:26 well it's a very small hole in
01:37:28 comparison to
01:37:30 it now it's a good sign there is blood
01:37:32 on the other hole
01:37:33 oh okay yeah that's because it's it's
01:37:35 that you hit something
01:37:38 and your body is healthy so it's
01:37:40 clotting out pretty quickly
01:37:41 okay all right should i put it out yeah
01:37:43 okay here we go slowly
01:37:44 go ahead pull pull
01:37:51 and that's it okay
01:37:59 so here this is for you to keep
01:38:05 i can't say i enjoyed that that was very
01:38:07 uncomfortable
01:38:10 but what's weird to me more than
01:38:12 anything is that you
01:38:13 seem to enjoy it you enjoyed the freak
01:38:16 out part of it
01:38:17 no i i like what i said i like that you
01:38:20 can override your body with your brain
01:38:22 to do things that
01:38:23 seem like they're not real yeah it
01:38:26 doesn't see
01:38:27 you know it's real because of what you
01:38:28 do to your body but most people see all
01:38:30 the things they're doing think it's a
01:38:31 magic trick
01:38:32 right they think it's a trick like okay
01:38:34 it's a trick like he's not holding his
01:38:36 breath
01:38:36 and you've done that thing with a sword
01:38:38 well you've gone through your body
01:38:40 yeah but it was not very thick and it
01:38:42 was through right here i didn't go
01:38:44 okay she didn't go through the organs
01:38:45 like this guy did no but i
01:38:47 but i think you can oh well obviously he
01:38:49 did it right
01:38:51 and swallowing this is what killed him
01:38:53 so
01:38:54 he got really he thought he could do
01:38:56 anything yeah
01:38:57 so he's like i'm gonna swallow this type
01:38:59 of thing and then i'm gonna bring it up
01:39:02 he swallowed it and he couldn't bring it
01:39:04 up and then he fell asleep and it
01:39:05 ruptured his heart
01:39:06 died he woke up they found him cold oh
01:39:09 boy
01:39:09 internal bleeding jesus christ
01:39:14 that is the thing about these extreme
01:39:16 feats right is that you
01:39:17 you possibly might be pushing the
01:39:19 boundaries of what's physically possible
01:39:21 which means you could die like houdini
01:39:22 like houdini died from getting punched
01:39:24 yeah in the stomach yeah
01:39:26 how does a punch to the stomach kill you
01:39:27 well so normally
01:39:29 like i had kimbo slice punching the
01:39:31 stomach did you really yeah
01:39:32 ouch yeah and then he i had him do it
01:39:36 again
01:39:36 and then i felt bad i didn't want to
01:39:37 make him keep doing it because it wasn't
01:39:39 you know right
01:39:40 because you as you know you can train to
01:39:41 take a punch that's yes obviously
01:39:43 so i basically had my trainer rich
01:39:46 beretta throw
01:39:47 heavy balls kick me in the stomach do
01:39:50 everything and i trained for
01:39:52 a long like a year just to take a punch
01:39:54 from anybody and
01:39:55 oh yeah comes kimbo boom oh and then i
01:39:59 was like
01:40:00 and then i said to him do it again so
01:40:02 and by the way i'm not even in top
01:40:04 physical so i said do it again and then
01:40:06 i but i could have obviously could have
01:40:07 kept going so
01:40:08 boom and i did that based on houdini
01:40:10 right right so
01:40:12 but here's the thing so houdini would do
01:40:14 this on stage every night and it's a
01:40:16 it's a great thing in the show it's like
01:40:18 look every any ten strongest people in
01:40:21 he's come punch him and uh so the and
01:40:24 these kids think he's invisible
01:40:26 invincible right like he could like this
01:40:28 is houdini man of steel whatever right
01:40:30 so he's sleeping in his dressing room
01:40:32 these two college kids one kid's like
01:40:33 watch out strong
01:40:34 and they punch houdini in the stomach
01:40:35 really while he's asleep yes
01:40:37 and as you know that's dangerous because
01:40:40 you don't have a wall up so
01:40:41 he ruptured something but he's a
01:40:43 workaholic so the guy is
01:40:45 in a lot of pain whether he might maybe
01:40:48 it wasn't related maybe it's something
01:40:49 different maybe he had
01:40:50 you know panda who knows right he's in a
01:40:52 lot of pain but he wouldn't let the
01:40:54 audience down
01:40:55 so he wouldn't quit his show so he did
01:40:58 his showing at the end of show he's
01:40:59 upside down in the water tank everything
01:41:00 else when he shouldn't have been
01:41:02 he should have been in the hospital but
01:41:03 instead he did the show that night
01:41:05 collapsed
01:41:06 on the stage was not from the water tank
01:41:08 but right after the water tank was
01:41:10 rushed to a hospital and then died in
01:41:11 the hospital
01:41:12 and what was the diagnosis what did he
01:41:14 die from well it was you know 1926 right
01:41:17 little
01:41:17 voodoo they died from voodoo
01:41:19 [Laughter]
01:41:21 yeah wow so when you
01:41:24 i mean that that's the thing about
01:41:27 someone who does
01:41:28 something that pushes it to the edge
01:41:30 like that i mean when someone sees you
01:41:32 hold your breath for 20 minutes what's
01:41:33 fascinating about is not just that it's
01:41:35 hard to do
01:41:35 but that you might die yeah
01:41:39 right yeah yeah or some people say oh
01:41:42 what
01:41:42 what's how's he doing right what's the
01:41:44 trigger you know so there's all
01:41:45 different
01:41:46 interpretations but the the worry the
01:41:49 thing that thrills people yeah it's like
01:41:50 the
01:41:51 you know that well yeah the the idea
01:41:53 that something could go wrong that's why
01:41:55 everybody watched the evil knievel
01:41:56 because he might
01:41:57 and he often did wipe out the spike yeah
01:42:00 yeah
01:42:01 what do you this thrill of getting to
01:42:04 that edge
01:42:05 is very dangerous right because you keep
01:42:07 pushing there's a danger but i feel like
01:42:09 if you rehearse and practice and
01:42:11 put the best team and don't just do
01:42:12 crazy things without like a plan
01:42:14 then i feel like the danger is like sure
01:42:17 the danger's there but i also rode my
01:42:19 motorcycle here
01:42:20 which is also extraordinary i've lost a
01:42:22 lot of friends on bikes yeah
01:42:23 right so sure i get what you're saying
01:42:26 and i i understand all that
01:42:28 you seem to like thrills
01:42:31 well i mean i like adventures like
01:42:34 riding a motorcycle trailer
01:42:36 adventure that is an adventure yeah it's
01:42:38 i i mean i look at people that do it
01:42:39 every day and i go that's a braver
01:42:42 california you're allowed to like weave
01:42:44 dudes so that's
01:42:45 that's kind of amazing in california
01:42:47 like go ahead
01:42:49 give it a shot fuck it you're here you
01:42:51 know
01:42:52 how where do you see this do you have
01:42:55 like a
01:42:56 grand vision of your life in terms of
01:42:59 like these stunts that you do
01:43:00 like do you have like some ultimate
01:43:03 threshold that you'd like to get to
01:43:05 wait we have to take a break i want to
01:43:07 make sure that i'm okay
01:43:09 okay hold on are you bleeding yeah yeah
01:43:12 we'll take a break we'll be right back
01:43:14 so we got to clean up your wound yeah
01:43:17 it was fine yeah you're you seem to
01:43:20 enjoy it
01:43:21 you really do you you were laughing
01:43:23 while they were cleaning it up and
01:43:24 checking it and you're like it's good
01:43:26 we're good
01:43:28 it was just uh what was it the blood
01:43:30 what was it that was bothering you
01:43:33 he's drinking all the water to prepare
01:43:34 for swallowing a frog i just felt uh you
01:43:37 know
01:43:38 too much uh of the magic becoming real
01:43:41 it's the magic how much water do you
01:43:43 have to drink
01:43:45 uh well probably to do what you want to
01:43:47 do well we'll see
01:43:52 [Laughter]
01:43:58 [Laughter]
01:43:59 what's up how do you have to drink it at
01:44:01 a certain speed because i've seen people
01:44:02 that can chug these they just shove the
01:44:04 whole thing down their face
01:44:05 it's almost like a magic chicken itself
01:44:07 they can drink it yeah those guys are
01:44:08 just
01:44:09 i had like the guy that was the fastest
01:44:11 work on it with me but
01:44:13 how many do you have to drink um you've
01:44:16 drank
01:44:17 three so far yeah plus the two out there
01:44:19 but yeah
01:44:20 so fives you have to drink eight total
01:44:24 do you need a bucket or anything to
01:44:25 throw the frog up in
01:44:27 do we have a bucket ice bucket
01:44:30 that doesn't seem like enough fluid
01:44:32 though bucket cam
01:44:34 there's a american flag bucket in the
01:44:35 back that big one
01:44:42 oh perfect oh look at that how
01:44:45 convenient
01:44:46 this poor frog has no idea because he's
01:44:48 a magical frog how do you know he's real
01:44:50 hmm he's real well you don't know that
01:44:52 could be a magic trick
01:44:54 well if it is it's uh
01:44:57 amazing you should sell these to people
01:44:59 that don't want biological frogs because
01:45:00 that's a fucking live frog
01:45:03 i mean he's looking at me he's moving
01:45:05 around he's bobbing his head
01:45:06 he's trying to get the fuck out he's
01:45:09 making the thing with the throat
01:45:11 look at him he's trying to get out
01:45:12 that's a real frog kids
01:45:15 no doubt
01:45:18 when did you uh start doing this the
01:45:21 frog thing
01:45:22 is that enough
01:45:25 what if it overflows there's a guy
01:45:30 there was a guy called the human
01:45:31 aquarium and
01:45:33 so the thing about most of the acts that
01:45:35 i'm doing by the way like
01:45:37 night after night usually the people
01:45:38 that did them it was like they're one
01:45:40 act so there's one guy called the human
01:45:41 aquarium and he was a guy that could
01:45:43 swallow frogs and bring them up but he
01:45:44 would do it you'd see him swallow them
01:45:46 and then you'd see him bring them up so
01:45:47 it wasn't magical it was like a skill
01:45:49 set
01:45:50 i would usually what i'd do is i'd put
01:45:52 them in my stomach keep them in there
01:45:53 for like two hours and then bring them
01:45:55 up and freak you out
01:45:57 right and i'd have a gallon of water in
01:45:59 my stomach so i have an aquarium
01:46:02 that baking soda gets rid of the acid no
01:46:04 food 36 hours
01:46:07 and then once i drink this we're at
01:46:10 a gallon or four liters so just under a
01:46:12 go so
01:46:15 so did you not eat for 36 hours in
01:46:17 preparation for this yes
01:46:21 that's a lot of not eating for this
01:46:24 poor frog's worst moment of his life
01:46:27 this poor little dude jaime just in case
01:46:30 you don't think he's real
01:46:31 he's real he's real oh there's more than
01:46:33 one in there no that's just him
01:46:36 it's just an i illusion
01:46:40 there was a little one in there that's a
01:46:43 decent-sized frog too by the way
01:46:45 you wouldn't want to swallow a frog that
01:46:46 large
01:46:48 mark twain has a quote he says eat a
01:46:50 live frog first thing in the morning and
01:46:52 nothing worse can happen for the rest of
01:46:53 your day
01:46:59 by the way back to the james nestor book
01:47:01 the one you're saying deep
01:47:03 or something he talks about that's
01:47:04 really amazing which is in
01:47:06 one of my favorite parts in there he
01:47:08 talks about how coral communicates
01:47:11 can i read this thing okay yeah sure
01:47:14 so he talks about it's one of my
01:47:16 favorite things
01:47:18 um that he talks about it's so amazing
01:47:22 so let's see we're deep
01:47:27 okay so
01:47:31 i have like a bunch of notes
01:47:34 what app are you using to read from uh
01:47:36 ibooks just because you could keep all
01:47:37 the books there
01:47:38 and you highlight things yeah with
01:47:40 ibooks yeah of course
01:47:41 i didn't know you could have oh yeah
01:47:43 yeah yeah and then you keep all of your
01:47:44 books here
01:47:45 right oh no i do that on my phone but i
01:47:47 didn't know you could highlight
01:47:50 i rarely read on the phone too i usually
01:47:53 use a kindle
01:47:54 yeah i don't i only use this is the
01:47:56 thing i like live by so it's like ruined
01:47:59 my life but also
01:48:00 also had it helped it somehow i guess
01:48:02 some way
01:48:04 let's see hold on it'll take me a second
01:48:06 to
01:48:07 pull it up i just like the kindle
01:48:09 because it looks like paper
01:48:11 you know the paper white ones yeah and
01:48:14 they're yeah and they're easier on the
01:48:15 eyes
01:48:16 yeah tricky on the eyes as well
01:48:21 okay so can i just read it yeah yeah
01:48:24 okay so it's part of what the aquanauts
01:48:26 and aquarius are trying to find out
01:48:28 they're also trying to crack
01:48:29 the more mystical marine riddles like
01:48:32 the secret behind
01:48:33 coral's telepathic communication
01:48:37 this is so crazy when you write to it
01:48:39 every year
01:48:40 on the same day at the same hour usually
01:48:43 within the same minute
01:48:45 corals of the same species although
01:48:47 separated by
01:48:48 thousands of miles will suddenly spawn
01:48:51 in
01:48:51 perfect synchronicity the dates
01:48:55 and times vary from year to year for
01:48:57 reasons only the coral knows
01:49:00 stranger still while one species of
01:49:02 coral spawns during one hour
01:49:05 another species right next to it waits
01:49:07 for a different
01:49:08 hour or a different day or a different
01:49:10 week before spawning and synchronicity
01:49:12 with its own species
01:49:14 distance seems to have no effect if you
01:49:17 broke off a chunk of coral and placed it
01:49:19 in a bucket beneath a sink in london
01:49:21 that chunk would in most cases spawn at
01:49:24 the same time as
01:49:25 other coral of the same species around
01:49:28 the world
01:49:29 which is crazy like you could take a
01:49:31 piece of coral
01:49:32 break it off put it in london and
01:49:34 another coral the same species will in
01:49:36 synchronicity spawn at the exact same
01:49:38 time
01:49:39 they have no idea why the synchronous
01:49:42 spawn is essential for coral survival
01:49:45 coral colonies must continuously expand
01:49:47 outward to thrive
01:49:48 expand outward to thrive to remain
01:49:51 healthy and strong they must breed
01:49:53 outside of their gene pool with
01:49:54 neighboring colonies
01:49:56 once released to the surface the coral
01:49:58 sperm and eggs have only about 30
01:50:00 minutes to fuse
01:50:01 any longer any longer and the coral eggs
01:50:04 and sperm will either dissipate or die
01:50:06 off
01:50:07 researchers have found that if the
01:50:09 spawning is just 15 minutes out of sync
01:50:11 coral colony's chances of survival are
01:50:13 greatly reduced
01:50:14 coral is the largest biological
01:50:17 structure on the planet and covers 175
01:50:20 000 square miles of the sea floor and it
01:50:23 can communicate
01:50:24 in a way far more sophisticated than
01:50:26 anyone ever
01:50:27 thought and yet coral is one of the most
01:50:30 primitive
01:50:30 animals on earth coral has no eyes no
01:50:33 ears and no brain
01:50:36 is that crazy that's insane yeah that's
01:50:39 what i thought it was
01:50:40 well it's fascinating too that you just
01:50:41 have no idea why or how
01:50:44 i mean what is the what's the mechanism
01:50:46 for their communication
01:50:48 the fact that if something's under a
01:50:49 sink in london it
01:50:51 syncs up with coral the same species on
01:50:53 another side of the planet like what is
01:50:54 it i think like one of the most
01:50:56 futuristic minds of our lifestyle
01:50:58 is jim cameron i think like avatar
01:51:01 and terminator 2 and like the machines
01:51:04 taking
01:51:04 like i think we're going to look back
01:51:08 and be like wow
01:51:09 he really predicted a lot he knew some
01:51:12 shit
01:51:12 the trees all communicating with each
01:51:14 other yeah yeah
01:51:16 well you've have you read about the
01:51:18 mycelium and
01:51:19 the the fungus underneath the soil
01:51:23 that actually the the trees utilize it
01:51:26 through their root structures and they
01:51:27 communicate through that
01:51:30 yeah there's some sort of a there's some
01:51:32 sort of a mycorrhizal relationship that
01:51:35 fungus has with with these trees and
01:51:38 they they actually somehow or another
01:51:40 communicate through each other as well
01:51:42 they're like
01:51:43 using the soil like this that's crazy
01:51:45 yeah we think of soil as being
01:51:47 dirt right just but it's there's life in
01:51:50 there yeah yeah all sorts of
01:51:51 biological life living in that soil yes
01:51:54 and these
01:51:55 trees and different plants actually
01:51:58 through their root structure communicate
01:52:00 and use the use the the fungi that live
01:52:04 in the soil and it's very very paul
01:52:06 stamets who's a
01:52:08 wizard when it comes to mycology and and
01:52:10 talking about fungus and
01:52:12 he's got some amazing work that he's
01:52:14 done just his whole life
01:52:16 studying mushrooms it's like so advanced
01:52:18 when he talks to you about it like you
01:52:20 you just really get this feeling like
01:52:21 there's something going on that we don't
01:52:23 totally understand
01:52:24 like the largest animal but fungus is
01:52:27 kind of an
01:52:27 animal it breathes oxygen and it
01:52:30 breathes out carbon dioxide
01:52:32 so the the crate is crazy yeah so the
01:52:35 relationship that fungus
01:52:37 that mushrooms have with the earth is in
01:52:40 some ways
01:52:41 more similar to us than it is to plants
01:52:45 because plants are breathing in carbon
01:52:46 dioxide obviously and breathing out
01:52:48 oxygen
01:52:48 so the functions are closer to function
01:52:51 yeah then they're living with these
01:52:52 things and there's
01:52:53 uh a group of fungi
01:52:56 i guess in the pacific northwest that's
01:52:58 the largest
01:52:59 living creature other than i guess like
01:53:02 biological organism you'd say was a
01:53:03 coral reef but there's something in the
01:53:05 pacific northwest that's
01:53:07 fucking enormous and it's just one
01:53:09 interconnected mushroom structure
01:53:12 wow it's very heavy yeah and obviously
01:53:16 the right ones can bring you to god the
01:53:19 right ones can connect you
01:53:20 to alien life and yeah you know the
01:53:23 future and
01:53:24 tell you what you're doing wrong with
01:53:25 the planet yeah yeah so there's some
01:53:27 there's something going on with these
01:53:28 things into a different part of your
01:53:30 consciousness well we're just very
01:53:32 egocentric and arrogant in our ideas
01:53:34 about what the human race means to the
01:53:35 rest of the planet because we have this
01:53:37 ability to manipulate things and send
01:53:39 texts and emails
01:53:40 it's just about our proportions
01:53:41 basically just because our fingers and
01:53:43 our ability to like
01:53:44 yeah but we think that's so important
01:53:46 because it's so important to us because
01:53:48 it's so significant
01:53:49 like the ability to watch a television
01:53:51 show or not be able to the ability to
01:53:53 fly in a plane or not
01:53:54 those things are so significant that we
01:53:56 think of them as being the most
01:53:57 significant things in the world
01:53:59 but meanwhile there's some animals like
01:54:01 like when you see a flock of birds
01:54:03 fly in synchronicity in some sort of
01:54:05 strange
01:54:06 dance and you're like how the fuck are
01:54:08 they doing that
01:54:09 and no one knows they really don't know
01:54:12 there's all this guesswork
01:54:13 they're not really sure exactly what's
01:54:15 going on how do they know how to travel
01:54:17 thousands of miles every season and go
01:54:20 back to the place where they spawned
01:54:22 like they don't know they don't know
01:54:24 like how does salmon
01:54:25 salmon figure out a way to get all the
01:54:27 way back to where they were born
01:54:30 they they make their way all the way
01:54:32 through the river to the ocean
01:54:33 and then when it's time to rock and roll
01:54:35 they get all the way back and they have
01:54:37 to get back to that one spot they can't
01:54:38 get
01:54:39 just any old river they won't they won't
01:54:41 make it they won't survive they won't
01:54:42 spawn they won't do it
01:54:43 they have to get back to the place where
01:54:44 they belong and something in their
01:54:47 little salmon brains
01:54:48 are in their salmon biological system no
01:54:50 and we don't know what it is
01:54:52 we don't know what it is but we fuck up
01:54:53 and we damn these river structures
01:54:55 and then they die and they die off the
01:54:57 pacific northwest has it
01:54:58 they had a huge problem with that and
01:55:00 they did they didn't understand it when
01:55:02 they first put these dams in place these
01:55:03 salmon would just
01:55:05 pool up and they try to redistribute
01:55:07 them to other places and then they're
01:55:08 like nope
01:55:09 i need to go back to where i'm from it's
01:55:12 weird man biological life
01:55:13 is weird and amazing it is amazing and
01:55:16 it's funny right like
01:55:18 we think we're so because we can do
01:55:20 things that other ones can't do but they
01:55:21 can do things we can't do
01:55:23 yeah we just don't put a high priority
01:55:24 on what they can do
01:55:26 yeah for whatever ego centric reason
01:55:28 yeah but i was
01:55:29 i was like i was swimming in a tonga
01:55:33 in the pacific northwest and uh it was
01:55:35 it was with humpback whales
01:55:37 and i was with my daughter and we looked
01:55:40 at the mother
01:55:40 and the calf you know i mean you know
01:55:43 swimming we were watching them
01:55:45 and um it was it's it's the most
01:55:49 beautiful
01:55:50 overwhelming moment i i'll show you
01:55:53 after uh some footage
01:55:55 but um then i was alone
01:55:59 and i was like holding my breath and
01:56:01 kind of free diving next to them
01:56:03 and and you know when you're not on
01:56:05 scuba it's not
01:56:07 they're happy to be around you and um
01:56:11 free diving and swimming with the mother
01:56:13 and the baby
01:56:16 and i'm looking at the mother and i'm
01:56:18 certain
01:56:20 certain that she's just looking at me
01:56:23 but in the nicest way
01:56:25 like in the most peaceful it was just
01:56:28 it's not like a shark
01:56:29 eye that's like whoa this thing is like
01:56:31 you know
01:56:32 so i'm like certain that she's like
01:56:37 being trying to communicate something
01:56:38 like that saying i'm still on the same
01:56:40 breath
01:56:41 i'm communicating and i i go like this i
01:56:43 open my arms up and turn
01:56:45 to the mother like this or something i
01:56:47 go like that
01:56:48 and the mother mimics the the humpback
01:56:51 mimics me
01:56:52 and turns right towards me and goes like
01:56:54 this right so now we're swimming
01:56:56 together
01:56:57 and i'm like this like kicking at fins
01:57:00 on and
01:57:01 the the humpback is doing the mother is
01:57:03 doing that to me and i'm swimming
01:57:05 in synchronicity with with the mother
01:57:07 and and the babies following her
01:57:09 and then as soon as i'm like done from
01:57:11 here and i go back down
01:57:13 she goes back down and it was like i
01:57:14 wanted to cry
01:57:16 but yeah it's like you think like
01:57:18 something but also their brains are so
01:57:20 much bigger than our of course they're
01:57:22 so
01:57:23 yeah i still have all this water in my
01:57:25 stomach so if i'm gonna do this i might
01:57:27 let's do it so
01:57:30 you need another one of those what is
01:57:32 the reason why you need
01:57:34 so much water to do this is it so that
01:57:36 the frog has a place to be
01:57:43 so the frog is safe you know i've never
01:57:45 injured a frog or anything
01:57:48 i'm sure he feels very comfortable
01:57:50 knowing that here he goes
01:57:55 oh jesus did he hop right out yeah
01:57:59 he's like i know what the fuck is
01:58:00 happening here oh hey buddy
01:58:04 hold on let me just okay so okay i just
01:58:07 usually like to give him a little get
01:58:09 him a little bath oh yeah
01:58:12 good okay so this is basically the
01:58:15 technique and i've put
01:58:16 up to 10 frogs inside look so i could
01:58:32 come
01:58:37 anymore
01:58:46 and now we could hang and talk for you
01:58:48 know as long as so how long does he stay
01:58:49 in there
01:58:51 um what's the lungs you've kept them in
01:58:53 there and they live like
01:58:54 three hours or so and none of them have
01:58:57 ever died nope
01:58:58 wow that's pretty mean how bad you have
01:59:00 to pee right now
01:59:01 on a one to ten
01:59:04 anytime anybody complains about needing
01:59:07 to pee i'm going to show them this video
01:59:14 10th tenth water and what are they eight
01:59:17 ounces
01:59:18 sixteen
01:59:23 it's more than a gallon of water yeah
01:59:28 now it's the magical parts i got
01:59:32 mouth empty
01:59:36 then i have to like get him to swim up
01:59:39 to the
01:59:41 how do you do that i don't know
01:59:44 i just like did it and had fluoroscopies
01:59:47 and looked where they were
01:59:48 and then saw that then and figured out
01:59:49 how to sort i did sword swamp
01:59:52 it's like
01:59:56 do you feel them moving around inside
01:59:57 you when there's a lot
02:00:00 when there's 10
02:00:04 jamie your face here he comes
02:00:07 no no i got it no first i like to get a
02:00:09 little bit of
02:00:14 you forcing them out now you can't talk
02:00:19 just get some more water
02:00:26 when's the first time you did this one
02:00:31 um i i worked on it i started like
02:00:37 three or four years ago and it's been uh
02:00:40 you know it's the first time you put the
02:00:42 frog in your mouth i got that
02:00:44 no i didn't swallow the first thing i
02:00:45 just wanted to get comfortable with the
02:00:46 food
02:00:47 salmonella yeah and then i got it again
02:00:49 after i tried it the second time
02:00:51 and then i built up a resistance to
02:00:52 salmonella
02:00:55 i hope it makes that's good if you like
02:00:56 sushi
02:00:58 mouth empty right
02:01:08 here he comes
02:01:20 this is obazar here it comes
02:01:29 it's because i drank so much so it's
02:01:31 like
02:01:32 i have to like locate them you have to
02:01:34 locate it kind of
02:01:42 the sound would you call this jamie asmr
02:01:52 this is so strange
02:01:56 so for people that are just listening i
02:01:58 highly recommend you go to the video
02:02:00 because you're gonna have to no no
02:02:04 no no no we're going to keep this up
02:02:05 exactly the way it is
02:02:07 people need to say oh
02:02:20 take out like a liter of water
02:02:28 oh my god so strange
02:02:32 oh i spit on biggie
02:02:38 it's called the water spout that's how i
02:02:39 usually put out the fire
02:02:41 oh my god
02:02:47 hold on
02:02:52 the frog is probably like what the fuck
02:02:54 did i do deserve this
02:02:55 i bet that frog was just like an asshole
02:02:57 person in another life
02:03:05 that's a gallon of water do we need
02:03:07 another bucket
02:03:09 maybe go get that plastic bucket in the
02:03:12 back
02:03:18 i don't know if that's good enough but
02:03:19 for now we'll just use that for now
02:03:22 it is uh quite preposterous to watch the
02:03:25 amount of water that's coming out of you
02:03:28 oh it's just good better
02:03:41 where is he at right now
02:03:54 boy
02:03:56 you got him in there put him in my hands
02:03:59 okay
02:04:03 there he is oh boy
02:04:06 here little fella little fella you've
02:04:09 had a rough life
02:04:10 you're not a road you've had a road
02:04:12 buddy
02:04:13 so that's the frog trick he's alive
02:04:17 and perfect yeah he seems fine don't
02:04:20 lose him
02:04:20 i don't want to lose him hey you want to
02:04:22 put him back in the jar
02:04:26 hold up let's get some a little bit of
02:04:29 water
02:04:30 fresh
02:04:36 okay
02:04:41 i think i'm gonna need more than paper
02:04:42 towels jamie
02:04:45 yeah i'm gonna wash my hands eventually
02:04:48 oh there is handcuffs here
02:04:50 oh you have a pair yeah jamie real ones
02:04:53 i don't know but is that just
02:04:56 coincidental
02:04:57 no no no there's a guy uh ed calderon
02:05:00 he's uh
02:05:01 a guy who used to uh work with the
02:05:03 mexican police at the border
02:05:06 may take a few paper towels too and he
02:05:09 uh
02:05:11 he brought us some handcuffs to teach us
02:05:13 how to get out of them right
02:05:18 just noticed that they were there random
02:05:21 that seems planned yeah but that's
02:05:23 really they were just here
02:05:25 well he gave him to me and uh he gave me
02:05:28 like a little tool
02:05:29 to show me how to uh yeah how to open
02:05:32 them
02:05:33 what's this plastic thing i have no idea
02:05:36 but he gave you tools to show you how to
02:05:37 open them like cow
02:05:39 i don't remember i have to go back and
02:05:40 watch the video if you ever get
02:05:42 handcuffed yeah how they get the fuck
02:05:44 out of the show like how to pick on me
02:05:45 how to shove it through the thing to
02:05:47 kind of like
02:05:49 go past the teeth of the lock to make it
02:05:51 open up so i had to pick them
02:05:53 yes exactly
02:05:57 is it not going to work i don't know
02:05:59 what are you trying to do there
02:06:01 so let's see like
02:06:10 what are you physically trying to do oh
02:06:13 i just want to see if i can actually
02:06:14 break them break them yeah like break
02:06:18 the metal
02:06:18 so like really break them for real
02:06:24 how do you usually do that i don't know
02:06:26 you don't know
02:06:27 no it's like really hard to break that
02:06:31 was it usually easy to break them no
02:06:33 it's always
02:06:34 very difficult to break handcuffs
02:06:36 because you're breaking the handcuffs
02:06:38 right but you're trying yeah
02:06:41 because there's some sort of technique
02:06:42 to it or something using leverage
02:06:45 that's what i'm hoping
02:06:54 how many days of your life do you think
02:06:56 you've spent fucking with handcuffs you
02:06:58 could just
02:07:00 boil it all down to time
02:07:03 50.
02:07:08 yeah this is probably boring for like
02:07:11 anybody that's that they
02:07:17 so you're just trying to use the way the
02:07:20 attachment
02:07:21 as a leverage point yellow thing yeah
02:07:25 that thing might be weird that yellow
02:07:27 thing but
02:07:29 yeah i'm trying to use like uh
02:07:33 it's like what is the yellow thing how
02:07:35 do we know
02:07:37 oh this is just how ed brought him to us
02:07:40 yeah i don't know if i can get these
02:07:41 things broken
02:07:42 hmm you want to keep we could keep
02:07:45 talking like now i'm like
02:07:46 going to be stuck on this yeah but
02:07:48 you'll be so preoccupied
02:07:49 yeah that frog's like what the fuck just
02:07:53 happened
02:07:53 look at him he's just sitting there
02:07:55 breathing
02:07:57 yeah imagine them being a frog you're
02:07:59 like well this is it
02:08:00 i knew it was coming one day that's why
02:08:02 i'm so scared of bass
02:08:05 by the way they're yeah these are the
02:08:07 the ones i get are like
02:08:09 normally they would be like used for
02:08:11 bait you know sorry
02:08:13 first i asked the guys i could give me
02:08:15 some beer
02:08:16 and uh they became my daughter's pets
02:08:21 i've never never ever injured or
02:08:24 heard a frog ever but how did you know
02:08:26 that that was gonna be the case when you
02:08:27 first swallowed one
02:08:28 the first one you swallowed you probably
02:08:29 had to be like no i didn't start the
02:08:31 fire it started with like bingo balls
02:08:33 and things like that i would put inside
02:08:35 come out
02:08:36 i started playing around so it started
02:08:38 with like you know
02:08:40 um how much water could i put in then
02:08:41 how could i spout the water out to use
02:08:43 it to put out the fire then could the
02:08:45 kerosene float on top then i went to
02:08:48 be so bad for what is kerosene like
02:08:51 inside your body do you feel it burning
02:08:53 no but like the problem is all that's no
02:08:55 the problem is all that stuff has a
02:08:56 residue
02:08:57 what does this guy do in general it's
02:08:58 oil based this is the kerosene
02:09:01 it's water spout thing haji ali egyptian
02:09:04 fire eater and human fountain
02:09:06 do you know of this guy yeah that's the
02:09:08 guy i'm talking about oh there he is
02:09:09 there it is
02:09:11 yeah he's an old boy there's a really
02:09:14 funny clip of see he's spitting the
02:09:16 kerosene and then he puts it out with
02:09:17 the water which is underneath because it
02:09:19 floats on top
02:09:20 yeah look how much control he has i saw
02:09:23 that act and wanted to like figure that
02:09:26 out
02:09:27 what year is this did it um like
02:09:30 almost a hundred days 1925. this is
02:09:32 almost done almost a hundred years ago
02:09:34 i mean that guy yeah he was called the
02:09:38 human fire hydra
02:09:39 that had to be a rough way to go however
02:09:41 he died
02:09:42 because he probably did that every day
02:09:44 oh
02:09:50 so let me get back to the question that
02:09:52 i had before you ran off because you got
02:09:53 you were worried about your arm
02:09:55 do you do you have like you've done
02:09:58 so many insane stunts and so many
02:10:01 really of these uh bizarre things
02:10:04 that require so much of you do you do
02:10:07 you like
02:10:08 have a thing in your mind that you have
02:10:10 to keep ramping it up and that do you
02:10:12 have
02:10:12 a place that you would ultimately like
02:10:14 to get to with me
02:10:16 with these things no i just constantly
02:10:18 like kind of try to figure out like
02:10:20 what things have been done in the past
02:10:22 historically and then i try to figure
02:10:24 out how to make them interesting and
02:10:25 then i figure out how to make them
02:10:27 kind of modern so it's it's not like uh
02:10:32 you know it's like it's a it's a small
02:10:35 step-by-step process and i think about
02:10:38 each thing
02:10:39 and then i try to put them all together
02:10:41 do you feel like you have to keep
02:10:42 pushing the envelope
02:10:43 um well i have like a few things that
02:10:46 i've been
02:10:47 trying to work on to get to that place
02:10:50 so
02:10:51 there is like a it's not a push the
02:10:54 envelope it's just i have a bunch of
02:10:55 things i've been trying to
02:10:56 how many do you have like on the back
02:10:58 burner in the back your head
02:10:59 i have two more crazy ones that i'm
02:11:01 trying can you share them
02:11:04 uh
02:11:07 i the the thing i will tell you is that
02:11:09 if you put them all together the the
02:11:11 letters
02:11:12 all equal out like my name so that
02:11:14 [Laughter]
02:11:17 and that's yeah that's all you can say
02:11:19 but yeah i
02:11:20 think that's i don't want to go too into
02:11:22 it
02:11:23 what do you what do you enjoy most do
02:11:24 you enjoy i feel like if you talk about
02:11:26 something too much and
02:11:27 then you talk it away i understand yeah
02:11:29 yeah you take away the magic of like
02:11:31 what he's getting
02:11:32 he's gonna do what yeah like when it
02:11:34 gets announced yeah
02:11:35 yeah do you enjoy doing these big things
02:11:39 or do you enjoy the live shows or do you
02:11:42 enjoy
02:11:42 freaking people just random people out
02:11:44 there like
02:11:46 all of it like so it's not like one
02:11:48 specific thing i kind of love doing card
02:11:50 tricks i love doing magic i love doing
02:11:52 things from history i love looking
02:11:54 like the the human aquarium guy uh you
02:11:56 know the the frogs and goldfishes some
02:11:58 of that came from houdini writing and
02:12:00 miracle mongers all about his act so
02:12:02 it's like
02:12:03 you look into the history of things that
02:12:04 have been done like haji ali the human
02:12:07 fire hydrant
02:12:08 and you find these there's a great book
02:12:09 that ricky j wrote who is an amazing
02:12:11 magician where he discusses and explains
02:12:13 everything you learn all these things
02:12:14 put them together
02:12:15 and then what i do that ricky thought
02:12:17 was amazing is
02:12:19 and insane is like actually take these
02:12:21 ideas
02:12:22 that that seem impossible but magical
02:12:25 and that's what the amazing part is
02:12:27 taking them from a
02:12:29 hypothetical image and then learning how
02:12:31 to do them so that's like what's amazing
02:12:33 about the whole
02:12:34 process to me and ricky's book called
02:12:37 learning pigs and farpo
02:12:38 there's so many bizarre but amazing acts
02:12:41 that exist in there so it's like you
02:12:43 look at them like
02:12:44 no that can't be real but it was real if
02:12:46 you believe it was real
02:12:47 how many of their how many of you are
02:12:49 there out there
02:12:52 like this must be of like i always think
02:12:53 of stand-up comedians as being a very
02:12:55 small
02:12:56 group of people that kind of only
02:12:57 understand each other there's a good
02:12:59 amount of
02:13:00 amazing magicians how many
02:13:04 a thousand on the planet
02:13:07 no there's a lot of guys that are at me
02:13:09 yeah and there's different categories
02:13:12 but the stuff that you're doing is not
02:13:13 just magic what i'm saying is like
02:13:15 this sort of like the crazy bizarre like
02:13:17 you're mixing at all
02:13:18 you're transcending magic into you go
02:13:20 into this weird realm of what
02:13:22 i like all these videos i like to use
02:13:23 the body as the prop
02:13:25 so i like to figure out how to do things
02:13:26 where like your body is magic and i
02:13:28 think that comes from like i didn't have
02:13:30 like you know a lot of many resources to
02:13:33 like oh go get which is lucky because
02:13:35 then i was like okay so what can i do
02:13:36 with like what's around okay an ice pick
02:13:38 or a bunch of water or of course you'd
02:13:40 be industrious
02:13:41 yeah yeah not again but like you have to
02:13:44 figure it out
02:13:45 but you also have do you balance it out
02:13:47 with like i mean you obviously
02:13:48 develop some problems from not eating at
02:13:50 one time
02:13:51 and you know you've you've got these
02:13:53 stunts where
02:13:55 they have this possibility of physically
02:13:57 injuring you
02:13:59 permanently yeah yeah sorry
02:14:03 the risks and the rewards yeah there's
02:14:05 not that many of those people out there
02:14:07 i hope not no that's what i'm saying
02:14:08 like the people i wouldn't worry about
02:14:10 them
02:14:12 but you don't worry about yourself well
02:14:13 i think i'm careful
02:14:15 you know yeah i'm still like
02:14:18 so we did one two three four five six
02:14:20 seven eight nine
02:14:22 ten ten five five liters basically so
02:14:25 that's like
02:14:26 a i think that's
02:14:29 in one shot i think that's a record i
02:14:31 don't think i've actually ever done that
02:14:32 many you never drank that much water
02:14:34 i don't think so i think i usually cap
02:14:36 it a gallon
02:14:37 well it's dangerous right you can die
02:14:40 from drinking too much water water
02:14:41 intoxication yes
02:14:42 yeah but i think that's if you like
02:14:44 flush it out too much but
02:14:45 but when you combine that with other
02:14:48 things then it's dangerous so that's
02:14:49 what kids have done like in the like for
02:14:52 tor
02:14:53 fraternity when they have to do those
02:14:55 hazing rituals
02:14:56 right they've died from drinking too
02:14:58 much water and there was a woman in
02:15:00 san jose yeah it is possible of course
02:15:03 it was san jose where she was on the
02:15:04 radio
02:15:05 and there was a thing like how much
02:15:06 water can you drink and she wanted to
02:15:08 win an xbox for a kid and she died
02:15:10 yeah yeah i think that's when your
02:15:12 electrolyte levels get messed up is that
02:15:14 when your heart stops working yeah
02:15:15 because
02:15:16 yeah so you your water becomes just too
02:15:19 much water in your system
02:15:20 and your body doesn't know what to do
02:15:21 with it and yeah that makes sense yeah
02:15:24 yeah and it flushes out and
02:15:27 to puts the imbalance off on your
02:15:29 electrolytes so when you do something
02:15:30 like this do you make sure that you you
02:15:31 consume a lot of electrolytes
02:15:33 beforehand because i couldn't eat or do
02:15:35 anything if you're going to do the frog
02:15:39 and why is my friend told my friend told
02:15:41 me do not do the frog out here
02:15:43 sounds gross i don't want you to have to
02:15:45 do that because i'm gonna have to listen
02:15:46 to it
02:15:50 it definitely does sound gross but
02:15:53 you you feel okay after drinking all
02:15:54 that water that quickly yeah but i
02:15:56 spouted it out
02:15:57 that's true most of it right there's got
02:15:59 to be a lot more inches on purpose
02:16:01 yeah jesus you're
02:16:04 a weird man david blaine you really are
02:16:06 that's what i was getting at like what
02:16:08 i'm saying there's not a lot of people
02:16:09 like you out there i'm glad you're there
02:16:11 i really am i'm glad you're out there
02:16:13 first of all because i think you're very
02:16:15 entertaining but also because
02:16:16 i i love when there's a new type of
02:16:20 person that i meet
02:16:21 you know and you're there's not i've met
02:16:24 a lot of people but you're you're in
02:16:25 this new like oh
02:16:26 and then there's this guy you know this
02:16:28 is like a totally new frequency of human
02:16:32 or just freak take out the quincy
02:16:36 both but i mean it's
02:16:40 it's a a very strange path that you're
02:16:42 on
02:16:44 i mean ultimately it's like at the end
02:16:47 of the day it's it's
02:16:48 trying to just figure out how to make
02:16:50 things that seem
02:16:51 as as close to magic as possible and the
02:16:54 process is really
02:16:55 difficult and tricky and laborious to
02:16:57 get to
02:16:58 but eventually you start to figure oh
02:17:01 this could look magical what's this or
02:17:02 this could you know but you seem like a
02:17:04 very
02:17:04 joyful person because of all this you
02:17:07 you clearly
02:17:08 love what you do yeah yeah yeah look at
02:17:11 that you sparked that
02:17:12 yeah yeah that's why i do it no you love
02:17:14 it
02:17:15 yeah that's what's interesting it's like
02:17:16 such a strange thing to love to do
02:17:20 stand no it's crazy you
02:17:23 fight take care down a long time but
02:17:26 that but i'm saying that's
02:17:28 crazy like it is maybe but that's the
02:17:31 same
02:17:31 it's the same you're pushing your body
02:17:33 to do things that
02:17:35 most people but you're basically you're
02:17:37 living in a place where
02:17:38 you have to override discomfort and you
02:17:40 have to override what your body's trying
02:17:42 to tell you not to do and you push
02:17:43 yourself
02:17:44 you know it's and then and it's that
02:17:48 whole journey of pushing yourself to do
02:17:50 things that you
02:17:50 physically don't think you can do or to
02:17:53 set a goal
02:17:54 that that's the best part i think i i'm
02:17:57 just
02:17:57 i'm fascinated by people that are really
02:17:59 far down on a path
02:18:01 that seems really dan you have we ever
02:18:03 brought up that woman stephanie
02:18:04 millinger
02:18:05 on the podcast before i follow her on
02:18:08 instagram and i know i've posted some
02:18:10 some of her stuff on instagram but she's
02:18:12 like a contortionist and um
02:18:14 she has like an incredible balance and
02:18:17 and and core strength
02:18:18 and she's this very small woman who does
02:18:21 insane things with her body
02:18:23 like she did this one she's on a
02:18:24 handstand and she
02:18:26 bends her back so that her butt touches
02:18:29 her head
02:18:29 like her spine is so flexible that you
02:18:32 look at some of the things that she does
02:18:34 and
02:18:34 they don't seem to be like watch this
02:18:37 look at this
02:18:38 yeah watch how she does this and look
02:18:40 and also she's
02:18:41 balancing on these posts right so but
02:18:43 look what she does with her back wow
02:18:45 look at that that is amazing amazing
02:18:48 yeah and then she stands with one hand
02:18:50 and she does by the way she does this
02:18:52 like off the side of cliffs and she's
02:18:54 incredible like look at the
02:18:56 way her body is contorting yeah that's
02:18:59 incredible she's
02:19:00 pressing her butt against the top of her
02:19:03 head
02:19:04 in the craziest way like it doesn't seem
02:19:06 like a person should be able to do that
02:19:07 and the amount of physical strength that
02:19:09 it takes to move your body like this
02:19:11 and balance while you're doing it it's
02:19:13 just it's
02:19:14 the the years
02:19:18 yeah this is what i'm saying like she's
02:19:20 so far
02:19:21 down the path see if you can find the
02:19:22 one where she bounces on the plates that
02:19:24 one the middle
02:19:25 where you see the the plate watch this
02:19:28 so she takes a
02:19:29 this is like a standard olympic
02:19:31 weightlifting plate right
02:19:32 so she puts it down so it's on its edge
02:19:36 and then she stands it on top of a bar
02:19:39 right so you got this like this bar that
02:19:42 was it's like a
02:19:43 like a small chin balancing yeah so it's
02:19:46 a round thing bouncing on another round
02:19:49 thing
02:19:50 it's amazing and then she lifts her
02:19:52 whole body
02:19:53 all the way up and over and does a
02:19:56 handstand on this fucking thing
02:19:58 i mean she's amazing it's
02:20:01 and again always smiling always like
02:20:04 joyful loves loves this but the physical
02:20:08 strength that it takes to do something
02:20:09 like that and the kind of balance
02:20:11 that's what i'm talking about like
02:20:12 someone who's on this crazy path
02:20:14 where if you you asked someone could
02:20:16 someone do that you'd be like no
02:20:17 but your body doesn't do work like that
02:20:19 that's not how body works but it
02:20:21 does you just have to take these little
02:20:23 baby steps for
02:20:24 years and then you look back and you're
02:20:26 in a different place and then also you
02:20:28 find a version of it and then you figure
02:20:30 out how to make it your own yes she's
02:20:32 like taken something and then made it
02:20:34 like a whole
02:20:35 yes new art right poetic
02:20:39 yeah yeah she's or like cirque du soleil
02:20:41 like when every time i go to see
02:20:43 i've seen most of the cirque du soleil
02:20:45 shows every time i go i'm like what the
02:20:47 f
02:20:47 how the fuck is that what do they do
02:20:49 what are they they're aliens
02:20:51 like yeah but they're on a path they're
02:20:53 just really
02:20:54 far down on this path of extreme
02:20:57 dedication
02:20:58 extreme focus and that's what you're
02:21:01 doing you're just doing it with
02:21:03 bizarre physical feats and magic it's
02:21:06 very interesting

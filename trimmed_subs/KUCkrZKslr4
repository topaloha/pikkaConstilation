00:00:05 came about and you said
00:00:07 uh you were gonna shave your head in
00:00:09 solidarity for a friend who has cancer

00:00:12 there's no friend and i was like oh no
00:00:14 yeah nikki's going crazy yeah i'm going
00:00:17 off the fucking deep
00:00:18 is what i was said yes i think we all
00:00:21 are
00:00:21 and i try i've been trying to like check
00:00:23 in on everybody because
00:00:25 all of us comedians have not had our
00:00:28 medicine
00:00:29 you know this is like we're junkies
00:00:32 we're laugh junkies we really are you
00:00:35 know and
00:00:36 i didn't realize how much i mean i knew
00:00:38 i missed it but i did one weekend
00:00:40 in houston like a month or a month or so
00:00:42 ago and then right right away i was like
00:00:44 oh my god i got my fix like i'm
00:00:46 i know and then you know talking to all
00:00:48 these people that are doing like
00:00:50 mark norm's doing shows in a park yep
00:00:52 you know burke crystal's doing drive-ins
00:00:54 i'm doing them too are you yeah i'm
00:00:56 going out next weekend
00:00:58 what is it have you done them yet no so
00:01:00 you have a terrifying any stand up
00:01:02 well no i've done stand up i've been
00:01:03 sneaking around just i mean i did uh
00:01:05 salt lake city i went out there in july
00:01:07 and did wise guys because they were
00:01:09 doing it really responsibly
00:01:10 it was fun it was good it was fine i
00:01:13 mean it felt good to be on stage but it
00:01:14 felt weird like i need to be going out
00:01:16 every night to feel
00:01:17 really good yeah you know it'd been so
00:01:19 many months that i just
00:01:20 i need to get get some momentum i need
00:01:22 to work out a little bit so it felt like
00:01:24 i was getting my sea legs back
00:01:26 but i had good shows and um and the room
00:01:29 is just
00:01:29 it's just you they're not seating the
00:01:31 room like
00:01:32 the way comedy is supposed to be seated
00:01:34 which is everyone bunched together as
00:01:36 close to the stage as possible it's like
00:01:38 it's the worst seated the the seating
00:01:41 for comedy shows now
00:01:42 is like a terrible club you know you go
00:01:44 to a club and they don't know how to see
00:01:45 and they just let people sit wherever
00:01:46 they want it's like a shitty open mic
00:01:48 when you first started that's the way it
00:01:50 feels like now
00:01:51 because everyone has to be spread out so
00:01:52 it's never going to feel
00:01:54 as good as it felt before with a sold
00:01:57 out crowd and no matter how good the
00:02:00 laughs are
00:02:01 them spread out in a big room they
00:02:03 didn't spread them out too much in
00:02:04 houston i'm going to be honest with you
00:02:06 yeah
00:02:06 i don't know what they did in houston
00:02:08 they said it was
00:02:09 75 capacity when we were there and i'm
00:02:11 like i don't know
00:02:12 that's what they say i don't want to
00:02:14 walk around with a clicker and start
00:02:15 counting heads but
00:02:16 there's a lot of folks in there no i did
00:02:18 one gig like that in st
00:02:20 louis that i felt like okay i don't
00:02:23 i don't feel good about this i did it
00:02:25 because i
00:02:26 wanted to i was far enough from everyone
00:02:29 to feel good about it but i felt bad
00:02:31 that maybe the audience
00:02:33 got there and was like we were sold a
00:02:35 different yeah
00:02:36 idea of what this would be because we
00:02:37 get in there and we're seated a little
00:02:38 bit too close but wise guys insult like
00:02:40 they did it
00:02:40 really like you i felt good about being
00:02:42 there i didn't feel like anyone was
00:02:44 going to get sick
00:02:46 it was definitely like a third capacity
00:02:50 i mean the guy is just struggling to
00:02:51 stay open and
00:02:53 it's it's so sad but it didn't feel good
00:02:56 all the loans are drying up all the the
00:02:59 relief is drying up
00:03:00 are there gonna be comedy clubs to even
00:03:02 go to after all of this it's a real good
00:03:04 question
00:03:05 i'm nervous it's a real good question
00:03:07 there's going to be a lot less
00:03:09 and then then what happens because a lot
00:03:12 of bars are going under too so it's not
00:03:13 like you're going to be able to replace
00:03:14 them with bar shows because
00:03:16 who knows how many bars are going on
00:03:17 there i know who knows how many
00:03:19 restaurants are going under new york
00:03:20 city i think it's something like 4
00:03:22 000 businesses are done that is
00:03:25 so in manhattan crazy something i think
00:03:28 that was the number and i read that a
00:03:30 month and a half ago
00:03:31 it's gotta be more by now four thousand
00:03:33 i mean it's
00:03:34 i haven't been there since before covet
00:03:36 even though i have an apartment there
00:03:37 and i just hear it's
00:03:38 it's just i don't wanna be there yeah i
00:03:40 have a good buddy of mine he lives there
00:03:42 still he's been there the whole time and
00:03:43 he says it's a fucking
00:03:44 war zone he said it's terrifying he said
00:03:46 first of all there's so much violence
00:03:48 there's so much crime you just can't he
00:03:49 has a friend that's a cop as well
00:03:51 and you know he sent me the the sheet of
00:03:53 all the things that happened that night
00:03:55 and it's
00:03:55 just nuts like so many shootings and the
00:03:57 shootings are off the charts so like
00:03:58 back to like the 1970s times like when
00:04:01 times square was a a junkie war zone ah
00:04:04 they had it figured out for a couple
00:04:05 years there
00:04:06 yeah well i don't know
00:04:09 what we were talking about james
00:04:11 altucher wrote a
00:04:13 piece about new york city's dead it's
00:04:14 not coming back it's a sobering read
00:04:17 it's in the post today or yesterday but
00:04:19 it's a fucking
00:04:20 sobering read because you read it and
00:04:23 like it's not
00:04:24 hyperbole everything he's saying makes
00:04:25 sense yeah there's no reason
00:04:28 for me to go back there i've i've been
00:04:30 considering going back just
00:04:33 just because you don't want to abandon
00:04:34 this city that you like
00:04:36 so much and people that are staying
00:04:37 there saying like you own
00:04:39 everyone left no thank god whoo but i
00:04:42 signed on for a
00:04:43 while for elite a year lease that
00:04:45 started march 1st
00:04:46 oh yikes the most expensive apartment i
00:04:50 like truly paying three times the rent
00:04:52 that i've ever paid because i was
00:04:53 supposed to have a really good year
00:04:54 because i was going on a theater tour
00:04:55 that you know ended
00:04:56 so i'm i'm out um i'm out a lot of money
00:05:00 every month and i'm trying to find a
00:05:01 sublease we keep like
00:05:02 lowering the rent i mean it's just i'm
00:05:04 i'm just out of year
00:05:05 that was a thing in altitude's piece it
00:05:07 said that the new york city
00:05:08 rental rates have gone down 50 percent
00:05:11 which is crazy
00:05:13 i was looking for an apartment in
00:05:14 january in february i just wouldn't wish
00:05:16 if i would have waited a month i could
00:05:18 have saved so much
00:05:19 so yeah i've got an empty place there my
00:05:21 assistant's just living there and it's
00:05:22 all my stuff is just
00:05:23 sitting there in storage i don't know
00:05:25 what to do i don't know where to go at
00:05:26 least your assistant's there
00:05:28 yeah it's nice someone's there but but
00:05:31 it's it's it's um this must be weird for
00:05:34 her too because it's an empty city it's
00:05:35 like weird moving around there
00:05:37 yeah it is i don't know i i don't know
00:05:40 what you do
00:05:41 all day yeah because that's the thing
00:05:42 about living in new york is that you
00:05:44 have a shitty
00:05:44 a small apartment because you're just
00:05:47 out doing stuff all the time now you
00:05:48 can't do anything
00:05:49 say just in a shitty apartment so you're
00:05:51 just i mean my apartment's pretty
00:05:53 nice i never got to step foot in it
00:05:56 before but uh apparently it's nice same
00:05:59 building a tele lives in i guess
00:06:01 i have had uh you guessed you never
00:06:02 asked him well no well she just told me
00:06:04 i think i saw a tell the other
00:06:06 day so i think he's in there he was
00:06:07 buying cigarettes
00:06:08 [Laughter]
00:06:10 there was a bunch of podcasts that i've
00:06:12 done about
00:06:13 uh apocalyptic disasters and downfall of
00:06:17 civilizations and
00:06:18 like the mayans and the egyptians and
00:06:21 you know
00:06:22 asteroid impacts but no but i was
00:06:25 i was always looking at those going wow
00:06:27 it's fascinating that's fascinating
00:06:28 but i never thought in my life that i
00:06:31 would see something
00:06:33 relatively minor in terms of like the
00:06:35 amount of destruction it's done
00:06:37 but in to human life in terms of you
00:06:40 know like it's
00:06:41 worse than a flu but it's not like the
00:06:43 pandemic of 1918 or any of these other
00:06:46 horrific disasters that have that have
00:06:48 happened but
00:06:49 to see such an effect that it has on our
00:06:51 civilization you go
00:06:53 well what if there was like an asteroid
00:06:55 impact or what if there was a solar flow
00:06:57 how much
00:06:58 worse would it be it could get a lot
00:07:01 worse
00:07:02 yeah i think it's i'm so scared i've
00:07:04 always thought that we were gonna
00:07:06 live to see the end did you really i do
00:07:09 think that why
00:07:10 people always go why nikki every
00:07:12 generation thinks they're gonna live to
00:07:14 see the end and it never happens
00:07:16 you know and i go well someone's gonna
00:07:18 be around for it
00:07:19 there will be people here when that when
00:07:22 the asteroid hits
00:07:23 when the super volcano erupts when
00:07:26 there's aliens land when the aliens land
00:07:29 yeah
00:07:29 or when they tell us that they've been
00:07:31 here a while when they finally reveal
00:07:33 that they've been here
00:07:34 is that what you think i don't know what
00:07:35 do you think i think so
00:07:37 i think they're here yeah i think if
00:07:39 there was
00:07:40 an island that had chimps that were
00:07:43 figuring out dynamite
00:07:44 we'd keep a close eye on them yeah if
00:07:47 there's a bunch of like
00:07:48 advanced like right right now we have
00:07:52 primates like lower primates we have
00:07:54 monkeys we have chimps we have gorillas
00:07:56 and then we have humans
00:07:57 there's nothing in between that used to
00:07:58 be there right but what if we found an
00:08:00 island and it did have
00:08:02 like australopithecus and uh you know
00:08:04 they had
00:08:05 you know maybe they had spears or maybe
00:08:07 they had some some primitive weapons
00:08:09 and you know we were keeping an eye on
00:08:11 them and someone had figured out
00:08:12 dynamite
00:08:13 and they would be studying them so
00:08:16 closely
00:08:17 but they wouldn't stop them and they're
00:08:19 trying to stop dynamite like let them
00:08:21 watch let's see what happens
00:08:22 i think they wouldn't they're just going
00:08:24 to watch us destroy ourselves before
00:08:26 no i think nuclear weapons is where
00:08:29 they stepped in and if you pay attention
00:08:31 to the timeline
00:08:32 of uh ufology if you when you look at
00:08:36 the ufo
00:08:36 history of sightings and of like
00:08:40 the really big sightings yeah all of
00:08:42 them came post the manhattan project
00:08:45 so once they i think once we started
00:08:46 detonating nukes they're like yo
00:08:48 these monkeys are lit like what are they
00:08:51 doing these fucking crazy assholes
00:08:53 they found a spot in nevada and they're
00:08:55 just detonating bombs all the time to
00:08:57 see how they work
00:08:58 but why are they just like kind of being
00:09:00 seen
00:09:01 sometimes slipping up we see them and
00:09:04 then sometimes they're not like
00:09:05 why wha what's going on there with
00:09:08 sightings why are they messing up i
00:09:10 don't think they are messing up
00:09:12 they want us to know that i don't think
00:09:13 they're terribly concerned
00:09:15 about us seeing them but i don't think
00:09:17 they visit that often
00:09:18 because i don't look at like i was just
00:09:20 reading about this uh
00:09:22 scientific research it was for escalante
00:09:24 had this uh
00:09:25 scientific research where they found
00:09:27 this mouse that they thought
00:09:28 had been extinct since 1968 is this
00:09:31 weird
00:09:32 sort of kangaroo-like tiny rodent it has
00:09:35 like kangaroo legs and it bounces around
00:09:37 and um you know this this is something
00:09:40 that people will go
00:09:42 and they'll study but they didn't find
00:09:44 it since 1968 so how many people are
00:09:46 studying it
00:09:47 not that many right right so how many
00:09:49 aliens there's a little fucker look at
00:09:51 him
00:09:51 it's so cute adorable look at his
00:09:54 christmas little anteater knows
00:09:56 i know it's a very and they thought that
00:09:58 this they thought this guy was gone
00:10:00 yeah yeah now he's back so it says
00:10:03 imagine a creature the size of a rat
00:10:05 related to an elephant with the legs of
00:10:08 a kangaroo that's been lost to science
00:10:10 since 1968.
00:10:11 that's the somali senji an adorable
00:10:13 elephant shrew
00:10:15 recently discovered in boy say that word
00:10:18 djibouti djibouti researchers from
00:10:23 duke lemur center association dibuti
00:10:27 nature and the cal academy found
00:10:30 that the somali senji not only still
00:10:32 exists but appears to be doing well
00:10:34 with population numbers appearing to be
00:10:35 quite high so but my point is like
00:10:38 how many people were looking for that
00:10:39 thing it's like a small handful of
00:10:40 scientists well how many aliens would
00:10:42 come here
00:10:43 how many oh yeah you're right maybe yeah
00:10:46 not that many
00:10:46 yeah we're that little mouse yeah yeah i
00:10:49 think so
00:10:50 alien i think we're probably more
00:10:52 interesting than the mouse because
00:10:53 obviously we we have the ability to
00:10:55 manipulate the matter
00:10:56 pretty cute pretty cute adorable i could
00:10:58 have watched that thing just
00:10:59 scamper about all day but we we are
00:11:01 dangerous we have the ability to destroy
00:11:03 all life on the planet like
00:11:05 if if russia shot at us and we shot at
00:11:07 them and then china jumped in and said
00:11:09 fuck it it's over
00:11:10 and everybody just started pressing the
00:11:11 nuke buttons this whole
00:11:13 planet would be wiped out of life that
00:11:15 we'd be we'd be relegated to bacteria
00:11:18 right with it quickly what does it
00:11:21 matter to them
00:11:22 if we destroy ourselves they need us for
00:11:25 something
00:11:25 this is the question why are we so
00:11:28 different
00:11:29 from all the other animals on the planet
00:11:31 why
00:11:32 if you talk to evolutionary biologists
00:11:34 there's a clear path between lower
00:11:36 hominids and human beings
00:11:37 but it's not a path that you could
00:11:39 detail every single step of the way and
00:11:40 there's some giant holes
00:11:42 and one of the big holes is the size of
00:11:44 the human brain
00:11:45 the human brain doubled over a period of
00:11:47 two million years which is
00:11:49 apparently if you talk to biologists the
00:11:51 biggest mystery in the entire fossil
00:11:53 record
00:11:53 they have no idea why because not only
00:11:56 is it
00:11:57 a crazy thing that an organ doubles in
00:12:00 size over a period of 2 million years
00:12:02 but it's the very organ that came up
00:12:04 with the idea of evolution in the first
00:12:06 place
00:12:07 it's the it's the organ that thinks it's
00:12:10 the organ that recognizes consciousness
00:12:12 it's the organ that recognizes
00:12:13 creativity and allows people to invent
00:12:15 things and
00:12:16 and you know and innovation and all of
00:12:19 the different things that are
00:12:20 responsible for all the crazy
00:12:23 the crazy technology that separates
00:12:24 human beings from all the other animals
00:12:26 all comes from this one thing the human
00:12:27 mind
00:12:28 and this human brain is the one organ
00:12:31 that baffles scientists they have no
00:12:33 idea what happened there's all these
00:12:34 theories about
00:12:35 well maybe it was uh psychedelic drugs
00:12:39 like that was terence mckenna's theory
00:12:40 that it was
00:12:41 uh the the consumption of psychedelic
00:12:43 mushrooms
00:12:44 and then it's other people's theory that
00:12:45 it was well we figured out fire we
00:12:47 started cooking our foods we had more
00:12:49 access to nutrients and then
00:12:50 hunting made people more clever and so
00:12:53 the the the more clever ones survived
00:12:55 and the ones that
00:12:56 that had the larger brain size that
00:12:58 mutation
00:12:59 was favored and natural selection
00:13:02 favored larger brains and then we
00:13:03 started
00:13:05 another theory is that we're manipulated
00:13:08 another theory is that these aliens came
00:13:11 here
00:13:12 eons ago and they found these primitive
00:13:15 primates
00:13:16 and they started genetically
00:13:17 manipulating them and they created
00:13:20 human beings now what makes it
00:13:22 interesting to me
00:13:24 is that human beings are so
00:13:27 different everywhere so different
00:13:32 we're we're like dogs in that
00:13:35 all dogs can fuck each other and make
00:13:37 baby dogs
00:13:38 right and all people can fuck each other
00:13:41 and make baby people but we look so
00:13:42 different like shaquille o'neal can have
00:13:46 sex with a
00:13:47 four foot ten chinese lady and make a
00:13:50 baby
00:13:51 yeah if you looked at animals
00:13:54 a great dane can have sex with a
00:13:56 chihuahua if it's possible or a bulldog
00:13:59 and make this like if you looked at a
00:14:02 wolf
00:14:03 and you looked at a poodle you'd go
00:14:05 there's no way that's the same thing
00:14:07 right but it is the same thing it is the
00:14:09 same thing so why are we different
00:14:11 but why is it the same thing it's the
00:14:13 same thing because we manipulated them
00:14:15 oh yeah that's the only reason why there
00:14:17 are
00:14:18 german shepherds we forced them to
00:14:20 golden retrieve each other yeah we made
00:14:22 them that way
00:14:22 we made them through manipulation we we
00:14:25 slowly but surely turn them and we don't
00:14:27 even know how so someone breeded
00:14:29 us someone very possibly could have
00:14:33 done something to human beings which
00:14:35 changed us
00:14:36 from these lower hominids and turned us
00:14:39 into a bunch of different versions
00:14:41 of what we call human beings right i
00:14:43 mean that's my
00:14:46 theory no but it's but it's it's an odd
00:14:49 thing
00:14:49 like do you know that most hybrids like
00:14:51 even bass
00:14:52 like there's bass where like a large
00:14:55 mouth bass will breed with a small mouth
00:14:57 bass and they'll make this hybrid
00:14:59 but the hybrids aren't viable they don't
00:15:01 become a separate species that's the
00:15:02 thing about like donkeys
00:15:04 like a donkey is it a which one's the is
00:15:07 it a
00:15:07 mule has sex with a horse and that
00:15:10 creates a donkey
00:15:11 or is it a a horse has sex with a
00:15:14 donkey and that creates a mule i think
00:15:16 it's a mule has sex with a horse
00:15:18 and creates a donkey but donkeys are
00:15:20 sterile they're sterile
00:15:21 most hybrids are sterile the difference
00:15:24 between okay
00:15:25 donkeys are different speeches than a
00:15:26 horse same family mules on the other
00:15:28 hand
00:15:28 are crossed between a horse and a donkey
00:15:30 okay that's it so it's a mule
00:15:32 is a cross between a horse and a donkey
00:15:34 but they're not
00:15:35 they're sterile they don't breed so why
00:15:38 even have a
00:15:40 mule because why do we need it because
00:15:42 they're better for riding
00:15:44 okay they're they're they're more
00:15:46 durable like in the wild west
00:15:48 they like to uh cross those two and then
00:15:51 people would like a lot of the cowboys
00:15:52 from the wild west like uh
00:15:54 even some of the texas rangers there
00:15:56 they rolled they rode mules
00:15:58 okay so the donkey and the horses so
00:16:00 they are so we would just
00:16:02 to ride and to be a better
00:16:06 transport you uh hold on a second
00:16:09 which one how does it where go back to
00:16:11 where
00:16:12 which one is it again the horse and okay
00:16:15 horse and a donkey makes a mule yeah
00:16:17 so mules are more durable than horses
00:16:21 they require less water they can last
00:16:24 longer
00:16:24 mules gets its athletic ability from a
00:16:26 horse and its intelligence from a donkey
00:16:28 so mules were were what a lot of these
00:16:32 wild west guys would prefer actually
00:16:35 okay
00:16:36 mules have smoother muscles than horses
00:16:38 think of a football player's muscle
00:16:40 build compared to that of a ballerinas
00:16:42 both are very strong but a mule has
00:16:44 greater physical strength for its size
00:16:46 and more endurance a mule gets its
00:16:48 athletic ability from his horse and not
00:16:50 intelligence from a donkey yeah well
00:16:51 let's just get rid of horses and donkeys
00:16:53 mules sound like they're the best of
00:16:54 both the problem is you can only make a
00:16:56 mule with a horse and a donkey
00:16:58 oh because mules can't they can't
00:17:00 separate each other right but we can
00:17:02 which is weird we can have sex with you
00:17:04 yes well yeah but we can have sex with
00:17:06 each other
00:17:07 like you know we can have sex with
00:17:08 people that don't look anything
00:17:10 can make something that can have sex yes
00:17:12 like if you looked at
00:17:13 certain people you would assume that
00:17:15 they're like
00:17:16 if you looked at uh yao ming right right
00:17:19 the
00:17:19 giant tall dude yes and you looked at a
00:17:22 a small man from ecuador
00:17:24 you would assume there's no way that's
00:17:25 the same species if you were from
00:17:27 another planet and you had no idea what
00:17:28 a human is
00:17:29 you'd be like oh this is a different
00:17:30 thing yeah yeah yeah but it's not a
00:17:32 different thing
00:17:33 okay it's just a different version of
00:17:35 that same thing yes but
00:17:36 like a liger which is a cross between a
00:17:38 tiger and a lion they don't breed
00:17:40 they can't breed they have useless sperm
00:17:43 it's what about bulldogs and like all
00:17:45 those dogs that have really they can
00:17:46 breed they can breathe yeah they get
00:17:48 well they're just
00:17:48 fucked they just manipulated them and
00:17:50 made their nose fucked up and they can't
00:17:52 walk
00:17:52 like asthma and i know they can't
00:17:54 breathe they're always they're
00:17:56 so trouble motherfuckers i feel so sad
00:17:58 for them a terrible thing but someone
00:18:00 made them that way they
00:18:01 they selected for that you know and then
00:18:04 also you know obviously people
00:18:06 their their bodies adapted to like
00:18:09 people that are really white well the
00:18:10 reason why they're white
00:18:11 is because people originated in africa
00:18:14 made their way to places where there's
00:18:15 no
00:18:15 sun and so their body developed this
00:18:18 sort of
00:18:19 like a solar panel for vitamin d that's
00:18:22 why
00:18:22 that's why people are so white they're
00:18:24 white because it's easier this is one of
00:18:26 the reasons why african americans have a
00:18:28 real issue with vitamin d because if you
00:18:30 live in a place like say seattle or new
00:18:32 york city where there's not a lot of sun
00:18:34 african americans their their bodies are
00:18:37 designed to protect themselves from the
00:18:38 sun which is why they have so much
00:18:40 melanin
00:18:40 but it makes it harder to absorb vitamin
00:18:43 d particularly when you're wearing all
00:18:44 these clothes and it's cold out and it's
00:18:46 cloudy
00:18:46 so it's incredibly important for them to
00:18:49 supplement with vitamin d when they're
00:18:50 in these climates where it's very cloudy
00:18:52 now how do you get your d you're going
00:18:54 out you take it
00:18:56 outside yeah i go outside too but i take
00:18:58 it i take vitamin d
00:18:59 every day like a pill yeah i take five
00:19:02 thousand yeah i take a
00:19:03 gel cap it's five thousand ius i take it
00:19:05 twice a day
00:19:06 it's varying vitamin d is very important
00:19:07 with coconut but isn't the absorption of
00:19:10 d
00:19:10 dependent on how much iron you have like
00:19:13 i just feel like it just goes through
00:19:14 you unless you have all the other stuff
00:19:16 you do need the other stuff you well you
00:19:18 need fat
00:19:19 like most of these muscle most of these
00:19:21 um vitamins rather they're
00:19:23 fat soluble some of them are water
00:19:25 soluble but they
00:19:27 digest better with food because that's
00:19:29 really normally where you're getting
00:19:30 them other than d which is where you get
00:19:32 from the sun yeah
00:19:33 but dr rhonda patrick she explained it
00:19:35 to me in a really interesting way she
00:19:36 said
00:19:36 it really is a hormone vitamin d is we
00:19:40 call it a vitamin and you could take it
00:19:41 as a supplement but it is a hormone
00:19:43 and it's responsible for so many
00:19:44 different things in the body and
00:19:45 particularly
00:19:46 for the immune system and when you don't
00:19:48 have vitamin d in your system
00:19:49 your immune system is very vulnerable
00:19:52 yeah so they were saying that
00:19:53 there's all these studies that
00:19:55 correlated with this they're saying that
00:19:57 out of people that were in the icu for
00:19:59 covid more than 80 percent of them in
00:20:01 multiple studies
00:20:02 had insufficient levels of vitamin d and
00:20:04 only four percent
00:20:06 had sufficient levels okay which is
00:20:08 really crazy well then there we go yeah
00:20:10 vitamin d
00:20:11 zinc and vitamin c they they're saying
00:20:13 are the three
00:20:14 most uh significant vitamins for uh
00:20:18 dealing with uh are you are you are you
00:20:20 scared of getting it
00:20:21 giving it giving it giving it yeah me
00:20:24 too i'm scared of giving it to like
00:20:25 my wife's mom or right or a guest
00:20:28 i feel horrible yeah so i'm i'm tested
00:20:32 so much god damn it i get tested a lot
00:20:34 yeah yeah every i just
00:20:36 you and i both did it that was fun yeah
00:20:38 but i mean i've had
00:20:39 this is my fourth test this week whoa
00:20:42 yeah
00:20:43 yeah yeah cause i did the thing at the
00:20:44 comedy store so i got tested then during
00:20:48 the day
00:20:48 and then i got tested again you know i
00:20:51 just i've been
00:20:52 tested i don't know how many times i've
00:20:53 been tested since the the whole thing
00:20:55 start but i'm fortunate that i could
00:20:56 have
00:20:57 you know the concierge md service thing
00:20:59 right
00:21:00 it's uh what did you do at the common
00:21:03 store the other night i saw
00:21:04 people hanging out though it's for the
00:21:05 documentary for showtime oh yeah
00:21:07 yeah it was interesting yeah really fun
00:21:10 was it fun to hang out again
00:21:11 it was fun that was the most fun i saw
00:21:13 pictures yeah
00:21:14 it was like whitney and annie letterman
00:21:17 and bill burr
00:21:18 and jay leno was there and paul
00:21:20 rodriguez and we were all just
00:21:22 laughing even jay leno's coming out he
00:21:24 misses doing i heard him say fuck
00:21:25 really oh yeah he's trying out jokes on
00:21:28 us too
00:21:30 yeah he was happy to be out we were all
00:21:32 happy to be out
00:21:33 yeah it looked like i thought it was a
00:21:34 tbt the pictures from that i was like oh
00:21:37 the old day
00:21:37 what that's two nights ago yeah yeah
00:21:40 two nights ago i miss it yeah they're
00:21:43 going to survive right
00:21:45 who fucking knows i don't know how the
00:21:47 laugh actor is going to survive right
00:21:49 laugh factory was struggling already and
00:21:50 the improv was struggling already
00:21:52 i mean these people are getting they're
00:21:54 getting loans these businesses and stuff
00:21:56 but
00:21:56 i mean how many fucking businesses need
00:21:58 loans
00:22:00 they should have just opened it up and
00:22:02 let people come if they wanted to come
00:22:04 let people work if they wanted to work
00:22:06 wear a mask you know
00:22:08 check everybody check their temperature
00:22:10 when they come in the door when you go
00:22:12 to texas
00:22:13 if you go to a restaurant they just
00:22:14 check your temperature they check your
00:22:15 temperature you wear a mask when you
00:22:17 come in they distance all the tables out
00:22:18 and they stay open
00:22:19 yeah and they're not making a lot of
00:22:21 money they're not making as much money
00:22:22 as they used to they don't have nearly
00:22:23 as many tables open but they stay open
00:22:25 you gotta give businesses the option to
00:22:28 work give
00:22:29 people the option to work give people
00:22:30 the option to go out if they want to go
00:22:32 out
00:22:32 this idea that they're just gonna tell
00:22:34 us what's best for us
00:22:36 but they're not telling us what's best
00:22:38 for us because they're not telling us
00:22:39 all the shit that we're just talking
00:22:40 about with vitamins
00:22:41 right and there's no talk of that there
00:22:42 is no one knows anything i'm getting
00:22:45 all of this from you right now there's
00:22:47 nowhere it's all you can just one place
00:22:49 go and get everything you need to know
00:22:50 and people get pissed at me for
00:22:51 repeating these things but listen i'm
00:22:53 repeating these things
00:22:54 they don't know people don't hear it
00:22:56 you're not going to hear it anywhere
00:22:57 else if you've
00:22:58 heard it from me 30 times i'm sorry it
00:23:00 just means you like the podcast you
00:23:02 listen
00:23:03 but the reality is there's not a lot of
00:23:06 other
00:23:06 sources where you're getting this
00:23:08 information i try to put it out as much
00:23:09 as possible
00:23:10 and i try to direct people to folks like
00:23:12 rhonda patrick
00:23:13 who will tell you exactly what the
00:23:15 studies are and she sent me something
00:23:17 recently there's another
00:23:19 correlation study between vitamin d and
00:23:21 covid and how vitamin d
00:23:22 the actual mechanisms of how vitamin d
00:23:24 protects you and it protects your immune
00:23:25 system from covet
00:23:26 yeah vitamin d zinc sea but you should
00:23:30 take all those things
00:23:31 you should drink a fucking load of water
00:23:32 how many vitamins do you take why are
00:23:33 you taking just like
00:23:34 fistfuls every morning what's your
00:23:36 regimen i take a bunch of different
00:23:38 things i take there's a supplement
00:23:39 called athletic greens i take that
00:23:42 it's really good first of all that's
00:23:43 really easy because you just pour it
00:23:44 into a bottle of water and i shake it up
00:23:46 and i just drink it yeah you know and it
00:23:47 tastes good so that's that's really easy
00:23:49 for me and that covers basically
00:23:51 everything but i always supplement with
00:23:53 d
00:23:54 and i always supplement with large
00:23:56 amounts of c
00:23:57 because those are two in zinc because
00:23:59 those are c
00:24:00 zinc and d are the ones that are
00:24:02 directly connected to the immune system
00:24:04 for kovid
00:24:05 but c is like if you have a colds
00:24:08 like c is one of the best for keeping
00:24:11 everything like that's why things like
00:24:13 emergency
00:24:14 and all those things exist like c is
00:24:16 just a great one for your
00:24:18 overall immune system and taking care of
00:24:20 yourself when you're sick so
00:24:21 and but i just think like having levels
00:24:23 of all those things like
00:24:24 fish oil that's a giant one yeah
00:24:26 inflammation fighting cbd i take that
00:24:29 every day i take cbd
00:24:30 every day yeah you have cbd drinks these
00:24:32 cbd kill cliffs
00:24:34 do you like cbd i need no i i mean i
00:24:37 like smoking weed and i feel like i get
00:24:38 enough from that
00:24:39 i'm sure you do you get a lot i mean i
00:24:41 just quit smoking weed
00:24:43 two months ago why because i just am
00:24:45 trying to figure out my mental health
00:24:47 and get a figure out what the hell is
00:24:50 wrong
00:24:50 i mean that's why i mean that's why i'm
00:24:53 sitting here right now
00:24:54 is because i was having a very tough
00:24:57 time
00:24:57 and i tweeted something kind of crazy
00:25:00 that i wanted to shave my head because i
00:25:02 really do like i just feel like
00:25:04 something something needs to change i
00:25:06 need to do something wild i don't know
00:25:07 why i'm compelled
00:25:08 my hair has been falling out i think
00:25:10 just from stress and i'm just like i'm
00:25:12 tired of pulling chunks of hair out it's
00:25:14 just it's distressing really that you're
00:25:15 losing that much hair i mean i well i've
00:25:17 just started only like washing my hair
00:25:19 once a week so when i do wash it it's
00:25:21 like so much comes out because it's been
00:25:23 a
00:25:23 week of just no strands coming out and
00:25:25 you lose 100 hairs a day so
00:25:27 once a week i wash my hair and it just
00:25:28 feels like i'm just
00:25:30 you know that i was in a fight or
00:25:33 something and someone
00:25:34 like i mean it's and i just put it i put
00:25:36 it on the wall and i just
00:25:38 it stresses me out so much and so i was
00:25:41 like i'm just gonna shave it and i'm not
00:25:43 going to but
00:25:44 i did just kind of want to put out a
00:25:47 tweet
00:25:47 that just sometimes when i'm feeling
00:25:49 depressed i just need to
00:25:50 let people know or just kind of
00:25:52 synthesize my feelings
00:25:54 through that way and i don't do it to
00:25:56 like make anyone concerned about me but
00:25:58 it really meant a lot to me that you
00:26:00 reached out to me and i was
00:26:01 completely taken aback by it that you
00:26:04 you sensed my dilemma
00:26:05 well i know you and so there was
00:26:09 something when you were saying also
00:26:11 there's no friend
00:26:12 yeah and i was like let me just reach
00:26:14 out to nikki
00:26:15 it was so nice and then it turned into
00:26:18 this
00:26:19 yeah i mean i i when i when i tweeted it
00:26:21 i was just like don't put this out there
00:26:23 hate when people tweet like
00:26:24 cries for help and then what was the
00:26:26 funny cry for help at least
00:26:27 thank you i try to at least be funny
00:26:29 with them but um
00:26:31 i it just really irritates me it's like
00:26:32 just just reach out to your friends if
00:26:34 you need help don't put out a tweet that
00:26:35 makes everyone worried about you so
00:26:37 a couple people reached out to me like
00:26:38 hey are you okay but it was yours that
00:26:41 um it really touched me because we don't
00:26:43 like text regularly but that was like
00:26:45 it was just such a real like
00:26:49 loving text yeah i know that really
00:26:52 meant a lot to me and i was going
00:26:54 through a really
00:26:55 fucking bad time last week this time
00:26:57 last week i was not in a good place
00:26:59 thankfully i came out of it but i keep
00:27:01 getting hit by depression like in a
00:27:04 major way
00:27:04 i've been trying to reach out to a lot
00:27:06 of friends uh lately over the last two
00:27:09 months like just send uh what's up man
00:27:11 you good it's really nice

00:27:22 no one can see each other smile when
00:27:24 they hang out they're wearing masks i
00:27:25 mean we all feel so disconnected
00:27:28 um i'm living with my parents in st
00:27:30 louis i my whole social life
00:27:32 was comedy like that i don't i didn't
00:27:34 really have friends outside of it
00:27:36 the only thing that's saving me is this
00:27:37 yeah me too
00:27:39 like doing podcasts and zooming with
00:27:41 people and doing different
00:27:43 um just face timing thank god for it but
00:27:47 it's i miss the connection where the
00:27:49 fuck would you what would we do
00:27:50 with no cell phones and no face time
00:27:52 what the where the fuck would we be with
00:27:54 no skype
00:27:55 where would we be i don't know like that
00:27:57 is giant for me
00:27:58 face timing just being able to like just
00:28:00 see people what's up and see their smile
00:28:02 yeah
00:28:03 we doing it we need it and um
00:28:06 yeah and it's weird to just hang out
00:28:08 with my nieces and nephews and
00:28:10 they're like uh three and one and then
00:28:13 we have to wear a mask around them and
00:28:14 you can't they can't even see your smile
00:28:16 you can't touch them
00:28:17 that's really bad weird for kids they
00:28:20 must be like why is my aunt not touching
00:28:22 me anymore my
00:28:23 i can't hug my w if i even get close to
00:28:25 my grandparents i hear no
00:28:27 no no no it's like this is gonna be
00:28:29 scarring
00:28:30 but the weird thing about it is if
00:28:32 everybody's just
00:28:33 tested why can't you just hang out like
00:28:36 what
00:28:37 what are we worried about like invisible
00:28:39 ghosts that come in and invade people's
00:28:40 bodies and then
00:28:42 you're not if you don't have it you
00:28:43 don't have it yeah you know
00:28:45 but you worry that between the time you
00:28:47 got tested and the time you're seeing
00:28:48 that person you might have gone to the
00:28:49 gas station and touched a nozzle or
00:28:51 you're not getting it that way they
00:28:52 don't think you get it that way from
00:28:54 surfaces i know we've wasted so many
00:28:55 clorox wipes
00:28:57 they've kind of abandoned that have you
00:28:58 noticed like they don't even talk about
00:29:00 hand sanitizers
00:29:01 hand sanitizer no no one cares about
00:29:02 that anymore it's just a mask
00:29:04 yeah it's just a respiratory issue yeah
00:29:07 it's just coming out of your mouth and
00:29:09 into someone else's mouth
00:29:10 i'm so annoyed i flew here from st louis
00:29:14 the other day and just sitting at my
00:29:16 gate and it's mandatory to wear a mask
00:29:19 on the plane now but people before
00:29:21 before they get on that plane they're
00:29:22 just sitting there without their mask on
00:29:24 at the gate just like
00:29:25 really just trying to stir up shit just
00:29:28 trying to
00:29:29 get away because they everyone around
00:29:31 you is wearing a mask how could you not
00:29:33 wear one you think that's what they're
00:29:35 doing
00:29:35 yeah they just they they want to prove
00:29:38 that they're not falling for it and
00:29:40 they're better than you
00:29:41 and they're it's so deliberate and it
00:29:44 makes me sick and it's it's hard because
00:29:45 i want to
00:29:46 shoot them a dirty look but they can't
00:29:47 really see how much i hate them on my
00:29:49 face because it's covered by a mask
00:29:51 so i really try to squint my eyes just
00:29:52 like you motherfucker
00:29:54 i was so furious the other day just
00:29:56 people with the loose mask down by their
00:29:58 nose i had a driver the other day that
00:29:59 had
00:30:00 his nose exposed and i just him like hey
00:30:02 can you you pull it up over your nose
00:30:04 the only way it works like do i really
00:30:05 have to you haven't seen that meme yet
00:30:07 with the guy with his dick at like how
00:30:08 has that not gotten to you that that's
00:30:10 how you wear a mask
00:30:11 yeah people just it's it's i don't know
00:30:14 i
00:30:15 everyone i'm i'm staying in marina del
00:30:17 rey everyone
00:30:18 walking outside is wearing a mask which
00:30:20 i think is a little much just like
00:30:21 walking down
00:30:22 the sidewalk we don't need it when it's
00:30:24 sunny out
00:30:25 there yeah this the the disease the
00:30:27 virus
00:30:28 dies instantly and when it's exposed to
00:30:31 sunlight
00:30:32 okay what why why don't we know that joe
00:30:34 i don't know
00:30:35 but uh brett weinstein who's a biologist
00:30:38 sent me this paper
00:30:39 where they showed that it dies instantly
00:30:43 in when it's almo or almost instantly
00:30:45 what's in contact with
00:30:46 uh fake sunlight like ultraviolet light
00:30:50 and also also actual sunlight so when
00:30:52 you're in sunlight
00:30:53 like you're if you're outside like
00:30:55 you're that's why the closing the beach
00:30:57 is so fucking stupid
00:30:58 like it's sunny like you're not at risk
00:31:00 as long as you're not like in someone's
00:31:02 face
00:31:02 you're not going to get it and did they
00:31:04 see a spike after the protest yeah after
00:31:06 all
00:31:07 for sure that was there was a 50 percent
00:31:09 it has to be but that was in the
00:31:10 sunlight outside
00:31:12 what did they stop as soon as it turns
00:31:14 dark out
00:31:16 no that's true of course not oh right
00:31:18 they were right when people were saying
00:31:19 that to me i'm like what the fuck are
00:31:20 you talking about
00:31:21 is everybody cinderella oh my god i'm
00:31:24 going to be young about something
00:31:25 if we we can just protest and gather
00:31:28 outside
00:31:28 when it's light up but but even then
00:31:30 people are screaming
00:31:32 right yeah it's different circumstances
00:31:34 that's just like spewing droplets
00:31:35 everywhere if you don't have a mask on
00:31:37 and you're screaming and other people
00:31:39 are screaming and then there's people
00:31:40 yelling at each other
00:31:41 so they're in each other's faces there's
00:31:43 like
00:31:44 very little chance you're not going to
00:31:46 get some spread if you get
00:31:48 what you know i don't forget it was it
00:31:50 ben shapiro said it was like having a
00:31:51 music festival
00:31:53 in every city for three weeks in a row i
00:31:55 mean it really was
00:31:56 it's like you constantly had protests
00:31:59 yeah so if you have
00:32:00 that many people it look it's not a
00:32:03 coincidence that it spiked right
00:32:04 afterwards but nobody wants to say it
00:32:05 because nobody wants to be insensitive
00:32:07 yeah no one talked about it i remember
00:32:08 the protest going on and
00:32:09 we were all like oh we'll see in three
00:32:11 weeks and then i don't remember hearing
00:32:13 about the spike that's a fucking for
00:32:14 sure spike that's when everything got
00:32:16 shut down in l.a
00:32:17 everything got shut down the hospital's
00:32:19 got phil again there's the cases
00:32:21 rose look at all it has to be either
00:32:24 it's contagious or it's not
00:32:26 okay if it's contagious and you get a
00:32:28 bunch of people together
00:32:29 they're going to give it to each other
00:32:30 right there's no way around it it's not
00:32:32 saying that it's not
00:32:33 a a good cause and that it wasn't
00:32:35 important to protest
00:32:36 yeah all those things are true but
00:32:38 understand that that's what happened
00:32:40 yeah i don't think you should stop
00:32:41 people from protesting but i also don't
00:32:43 think you should stop people from
00:32:44 working
00:32:44 i don't think you should stop people
00:32:46 from going to the gym you should give
00:32:47 people the opportunity to do whatever
00:32:48 they want to do
00:32:49 that's what america is supposed to be
00:32:50 about right the problem is the
00:32:52 hospitals the icu beds and all that
00:32:55 stuff restaurants respirators but they
00:32:57 don't even use respirators anymore one
00:32:58 of the things they're finding with
00:32:59 respirators is
00:33:00 the vast majority of the people that put
00:33:02 on respirators died
00:33:04 yeah because when you're at that point
00:33:05 not necessarily
00:33:07 according to michael yo's doctor he told
00:33:09 him if i put you on a respirator you're
00:33:10 gonna die
00:33:11 because your body's gonna stop working
00:33:14 because
00:33:14 because you need to breathe for you
00:33:16 right yeah and then still stop fighting
00:33:18 get off the respirator it's hard for
00:33:20 your body to breathe
00:33:22 huh yeah so they thought you needed
00:33:24 respirators
00:33:25 right that was the big thing right then
00:33:26 now they've adjusted that position they
00:33:28 don't they don't think it's a good idea
00:33:30 to put people on respirators anymore
00:33:31 unless they're like really bad like
00:33:33 they're about to die
00:33:34 right yeah it's that's life support yes
00:33:38 exactly so now they use more like cpap
00:33:40 machines which are just
00:33:42 they give you squares sleep apnea yes
00:33:45 yeah so instead of breathing for you it
00:33:47 just introduces more oxygen into your
00:33:49 system
00:33:49 okay so that and you know there's so
00:33:52 many things that we
00:33:53 thought in the beginning that our mask
00:33:55 thing it's like
00:33:56 i don't care if you're sitting at my
00:33:58 gate and you don't believe in masking
00:33:59 you think we're all
00:34:00 so crazy and we're all just sheep
00:34:02 wearing masks just everyone around you
00:34:04 is doing it just do it
00:34:06 if just to be polite even if you don't
00:34:08 believe
00:34:09 cause like i was saying like walking
00:34:10 today outside and seeing people with
00:34:12 masks on
00:34:13 i was kind of like i think this is kind
00:34:15 of stupid but i felt like out of respect
00:34:17 for them
00:34:18 i'm gonna wear a mask even though i
00:34:20 don't think i really need to be wearing
00:34:22 it
00:34:22 i'm gonna do it so that's all i ask
00:34:24 people to do
00:34:25 is just if someone around you if i go
00:34:28 over to someone's house
00:34:29 and they they want me to take my shoes
00:34:31 off but i don't really believe in doing
00:34:33 that
00:34:33 i'm still going to do it because they do
00:34:35 it yeah just to be nice
00:34:37 yes and i mean and i i just think the
00:34:40 peer pressure
00:34:41 have you i've early when this was
00:34:43 happening
00:34:44 i was like getting invited to like
00:34:46 social distance barbecues and things
00:34:48 like that when they were like just
00:34:49 trying it out
00:34:50 and going over to these things and be
00:34:52 under the understanding that we're all
00:34:53 going to stay six feet apart and wear
00:34:55 masks and then you get there and people
00:34:56 are hugging and people are close
00:34:58 and you just kind of feel peer pressured
00:35:00 into doing it well people go
00:35:02 back to the normal patterns normal
00:35:03 patterns is you know especially when
00:35:05 people are drinking
00:35:06 yeah the drinking yeah like we know
00:35:08 what's fucked up was like the trump
00:35:10 rally
00:35:10 when he had that big rally when he had
00:35:12 it in a stadium no one was wearing a
00:35:13 mask
00:35:14 and then herman cain died i know and
00:35:17 they were like well it could have been
00:35:19 many of the place he was or even though
00:35:21 it's like
00:35:22 could have been to that one place with
00:35:23 10 000 people all in one place
00:35:25 yeah yeah but i mean even i go into
00:35:29 these parties
00:35:30 being like i'm gonna keep my distance
00:35:31 i'm only going if it's done right and
00:35:33 then i get there
00:35:34 and you feel so stupid being the only
00:35:36 one who has a mask on or
00:35:38 and you feel it's hard to stand up for
00:35:40 yourself sometimes i'm like fine spit in
00:35:42 my mouth i guess we used to do that
00:35:44 well if there was these tests where you
00:35:47 could do it
00:35:48 instantaneously and then you know you
00:35:50 could just have them at comedy clubs yes
00:35:52 you just have people take a test as
00:35:53 they're walking through the door aren't
00:35:54 those coming out soon
00:35:56 the white house has them really yeah
00:35:58 like an immediate test
00:35:59 yeah my friend went to the white house
00:36:01 and they test them and you have it
00:36:02 within a couple of minutes
00:36:04 all right well that'll solve a lot of
00:36:06 issues that would be everything
00:36:07 if you just had like a giant you know
00:36:10 a line where everybody's spread out by
00:36:12 six feet you test them
00:36:14 on the line you know you write your name
00:36:16 down or or you have to register
00:36:19 maybe the show is at eight you have to
00:36:20 show up at seven and get tested
00:36:23 and then you could be there at eight
00:36:24 look it could be inconvenient but it's
00:36:25 way better than having no show
00:36:27 and then you could go there and no one
00:36:28 could have a mask you'd have a regular
00:36:30 club
00:36:30 and ever have the place packed it's
00:36:33 possible
00:36:34 i can't believe i took that for granted
00:36:37 so much well i don't you just always
00:36:40 thought it would be
00:36:41 you'd be able to do that you could think
00:36:42 i thought anything else could happen in
00:36:44 my career i'll always have stand up to
00:36:46 fall back on well everybody thought that
00:36:48 and everybody like how many people
00:36:50 didn't have a podcast how many people
00:36:51 didn't have any
00:36:52 if i didn't have a podcast i would be
00:36:55 first of all i'd be
00:36:56 bouncing off the walls i wouldn't know
00:36:58 what the fuck to do and then i would be
00:37:00 at a point where i was thinking like hey
00:37:01 i gotta make a living
00:37:02 yeah like what do i need to do to make
00:37:04 maybe i need to get a regular job like
00:37:05 how many comics are getting jobs
00:37:07 a lot of them you can't get a job in
00:37:09 show business because they're not
00:37:10 feeling anything
00:37:11 so just so what would you do teach i
00:37:14 would have to
00:37:15 i'd go to no i can't even teach martial
00:37:17 arts because gyms are close right
00:37:19 it's like what would i teach and if you
00:37:22 teach you got to do it over zoom now
00:37:24 to be a good teacher nobody wants to oh
00:37:26 my god if you want to get paid to teach
00:37:28 over zoom
00:37:28 good luck nobody wants to pay for that
00:37:31 yeah
00:37:32 well i mean i'm think yeah thank god for
00:37:35 podcasting
00:37:37 thank god you know i'm trying to write a
00:37:39 goddamn book
00:37:40 have you have you written a book no why
00:37:43 haven't you written a book
00:37:44 well i got a deal to write a book once
00:37:46 and the the editors were so annoying i
00:37:48 gave them their money back
00:37:50 yeah just like hey do you have these
00:37:52 pages yet hey
00:37:53 we look like just they based it on some
00:37:55 stuff that i wrote on my blog
00:37:57 that was you know sometimes funny just
00:37:59 but but weird just
00:38:00 thoughts that i had yeah and uh but then
00:38:04 once i started turning in stuff they're
00:38:06 like
00:38:07 we want to transcribe your stand-up
00:38:09 because jerry seinfeld did that
00:38:10 and and and and uh fucking
00:38:14 who else did it george carlin and i'm
00:38:16 like look george carlin did it because
00:38:17 he needed money
00:38:18 all right he broke taxes and i don't
00:38:20 know why seinfeld did it
00:38:21 they probably just paid him and he said
00:38:23 okay but i'm like i'm not doing that
00:38:25 like if i'm writing i want to write a
00:38:26 book you're going to write it's supposed
00:38:27 to be consumed in book
00:38:28 form stand up is supposed to be consumed
00:38:30 on stage that's that's
00:38:32 they're different things it really
00:38:33 helped me though reading those
00:38:35 stand-up kind of transcribed stand-up
00:38:37 books when i first started stand up to
00:38:38 like
00:38:40 read jokes and like learn the craft of
00:38:42 writing a joke and the consolidation of
00:38:44 words like
00:38:45 i turned to those books where like
00:38:46 people would just take stand up and
00:38:48 and write it down but yeah yeah beyond
00:38:49 that i from a comedian i think they
00:38:51 it's it's an easy way out to repeat like
00:38:54 when i first started doing stand-up one
00:38:56 of the things that i used to do
00:38:57 is i would do other people's bits for my
00:39:00 friends
00:39:01 mm-hmm like i do a kindest bit or a
00:39:02 richard pryor bit for one of my friends
00:39:04 and like that
00:39:05 sort of got me into like the rhythm of
00:39:07 stand up
00:39:08 and then i read that hunter s thompson
00:39:10 when he was learning how to write he
00:39:12 would
00:39:13 literally write down the great gatsby
00:39:16 line for line so he would sit there
00:39:19 and and re-type the great gatsby just so
00:39:22 he can get an idea of the rhythm of the
00:39:24 pro
00:39:25 yeah yeah i've been doing that recently
00:39:28 with stand-up like i've stepped away
00:39:30 from watching stand-up but i've been
00:39:31 watching it again just because
00:39:32 i need to remember how to do it and why
00:39:35 i love it and
00:39:37 and so much i think of who i became as a
00:39:40 stand-up
00:39:41 started out just like trying to copy
00:39:44 people yeah
00:39:44 just trying to figure out how do you do
00:39:46 this and watching it so much and ending
00:39:48 up
00:39:48 sounding like a mixture of all the
00:39:51 people that i loved so much
00:39:52 yeah that's always weird right the
00:39:55 beginning you're always like a copy
00:39:56 of the people you admire yeah i mean i
00:39:59 still
00:40:00 look at some of the things i do and i'm
00:40:01 like oh that you picked that up from
00:40:03 silverman
00:40:04 yeah yeah you picked that up from uh
00:40:07 gaff again yeah hedberg i mean you're
00:40:10 just a mixture of everyone that you love
00:40:12 and then
00:40:12 eventually you gain some autonomy and
00:40:15 you figure out stuff that works for you
00:40:16 and who is truly you but
00:40:18 even my own personality before i did
00:40:21 stand up is all based upon
00:40:23 me ripping off the popular girls the way
00:40:26 they talked and the way they acted
00:40:28 of course there was one girl that had
00:40:29 like kind of a lazy eye in my
00:40:32 in my high school who like was really
00:40:34 hot and like all the guys liked
00:40:36 and i started like kind of like having i
00:40:39 would just
00:40:40 do it i would just try to like have like
00:40:43 a slightly like
00:40:45 it would just happen because i was like
00:40:47 trying to get any way to for people to
00:40:49 like me
00:40:50 there was another girl who talked like a
00:40:52 baby and i would just like
00:40:53 start talking like this and like no
00:40:55 people liked her because she was hot not
00:40:57 because her voice was like a baby
00:40:59 so i just i really am if if i listen to
00:41:02 someone too much i start
00:41:03 i start sounding like them and and
00:41:05 copying them it's a real problem that's
00:41:07 why sometimes i can't watch
00:41:09 some of the stand-ups i love because i
00:41:10 just start sounding like them
00:41:12 but i can't help it i just dated a girl
00:41:13 out of kind of a lazy eye and she was
00:41:15 really hot
00:41:16 and i had like a fetish for lazy eyes
00:41:18 for a while okay
00:41:19 well there we go she had like a one
00:41:22 slightly lazy eye
00:41:24 and i just thought it was really hot
00:41:25 afterwards because she was a freak
00:41:27 so like i just associated lazy was she a
00:41:29 freak like what would she do
00:41:30 really horny oh yeah she's just really
00:41:32 sexual like all the time just wanted
00:41:34 all the time i wanted to do weird stuff
00:41:36 yeah i wanted to get stuffed
00:41:37 yeah she was all the time really horny
00:41:40 that's so funny yeah
00:41:41 and i was 21 and she said you were down
00:41:43 she was older than me too
00:41:44 so it was uh it was interesting how much
00:41:46 older a couple years like she was 25
00:41:48 when i was 21.
00:41:50 when you were young what was the oldest
00:41:51 you went
00:41:53 did you ever i think i dated a girl was
00:41:54 35 when i was like 23
00:41:58 okay one in a couple days with yeah but
00:42:00 it's usually like you're just getting
00:42:01 used
00:42:02 by some chick who wants to get gorilla
00:42:04 fucked
00:42:07 it's usually some woman who's tired of
00:42:10 like dating guys who work in an office
00:42:11 or something
00:42:12 she goes and finds them see i have young
00:42:14 guys
00:42:15 coming after me and i feel like they're
00:42:17 using me
00:42:19 so that they can just like somehow have
00:42:21 a story about like fucking an older
00:42:23 woman
00:42:23 and i don't want to be that like that's
00:42:25 interesting i i don't want to
00:42:27 why wouldn't you just think they're
00:42:28 attracted to you because you're
00:42:29 confident and intelligent
00:42:30 um because i think it's some weird
00:42:32 fetish they have where they like
00:42:34 they are they had a speech therapist
00:42:37 that they
00:42:38 like got boners for and i remind them of
00:42:41 her
00:42:41 i like theirs i think that you're sexy
00:42:45 why wouldn't you just decide i don't
00:42:47 know because i just don't look at myself
00:42:49 that way
00:42:50 i cannot there are certain times where i
00:42:52 do feel really sexy and i um
00:42:54 and i ca i can feel that way but
00:42:56 generally when someone's into me i go
00:42:58 what's going on here what do you want
00:43:00 because it can't be that you want to
00:43:01 have sex with me
00:43:02 even though i know i'm an attractive
00:43:04 girl and like i work on being attractive
00:43:06 it's not like i'm
00:43:07 i don't think i'm a dog you're
00:43:08 suspicious yeah i'm suspicious and you
00:43:11 want to know
00:43:11 why because sometimes i'm fucking right
00:43:14 and especially since i've gotten a
00:43:15 little bit more famous
00:43:17 if that happens and i and because it
00:43:21 as i've gotten a little slightly more
00:43:22 famous my self-esteem
00:43:24 has risen a bit in terms of just i like
00:43:27 myself and i'm like oh maybe this guy
00:43:29 does like me for me
00:43:30 and then it happens that they just want
00:43:34 an autograph from you or they want
00:43:38 honestly someone wrote me that today and
00:43:41 a guy that has been
00:43:42 interested in me and asking me out a ton
00:43:44 and he just wrote me today like
00:43:45 hey i heard you're gonna be on rogan um
00:43:48 if there's any chance you could get an
00:43:49 autograph from him
00:43:50 that would be so cool thank you so and i
00:43:52 just wrote back no like just
00:43:54 no with nothing else and it felt so
00:43:57 good no and you don't even bother
00:43:59 putting a period no i didn't say no
00:44:01 i'm sorry no i don't feel comfortable
00:44:03 doing that no
00:44:04 no no but that that's happened before
00:44:08 so you worry that they look at you as
00:44:10 being someone who's
00:44:12 got a high profile and maybe if they
00:44:14 connect themselves to you
00:44:15 it can help their life in some way
00:44:17 they'll get to fuck other girls in their
00:44:19 social circle because they said they
00:44:20 fucked a girl that was
00:44:22 on celebrity game night playing
00:44:23 badminton with bob
00:44:25 saget
00:44:28 i mean that's how i feel is that and i'm
00:44:31 not
00:44:32 wrong like this does happen there was
00:44:34 another instance where a guy
00:44:36 got a pic a guy thought liked me and i
00:44:38 do think he likes me but he got a
00:44:39 picture with me
00:44:40 and i guess we we both weren't wearing
00:44:42 masks in the picture i guess we were too
00:44:44 close to each other and he couldn't post
00:44:45 the picture because
00:44:47 he felt like it would be bad a bad look
00:44:49 for me we're not wearing masks but we
00:44:50 were like
00:44:51 for me i was like we're far enough apart
00:44:52 but do what you want and um and he's and
00:44:55 i go okay he's like oh so i'm not gonna
00:44:56 post it i was like okay that's totally
00:44:58 fine
00:44:58 and then um he's like but i would really
00:45:00 like to see you again like i really
00:45:01 liked hanging out with you i'd love to
00:45:03 take you out sometime and i was like hey

00:46:19 the fact that i know you
00:46:20 there was this guy on a plane
00:46:23 a couple weeks ago and i met him at my
00:46:26 gate and usually when i fly
00:46:28 i just like put on my headphones and
00:46:30 like
00:46:31 sleep mask and i just try to stay i
00:46:34 don't want anyone talking about mouth
00:46:35 mask and sleep mask
00:46:37 oh my god and face shield i've been
00:46:39 wearing the shield
00:46:42 yeah i want to make a statement that
00:46:45 like i
00:46:46 hate all of you not wearing a mask and
00:46:48 now i have to doubly protect myself and
00:46:50 look what you've made me
00:46:51 do um i want to send that message i love
00:46:53 wearing the shield at first i felt
00:46:54 stupid now i feel cool
00:46:56 and if anyone's going to judge me they
00:46:57 can't recognize me they can't even see
00:46:58 me in there so it's great
00:47:00 so usually but when i fly even pre-covet
00:47:02 i would just always kind of
00:47:04 i just didn't want anyone talking to me
00:47:06 i've been
00:47:07 caught in conversations on planes with
00:47:09 people and it's just brutal
00:47:11 it's brutal and i learned the hard way
00:47:12 but like years and years ago
00:47:14 some people just don't stop and you can
00:47:16 never close your eyes you can never
00:47:17 relax
00:47:18 these do close your eyes and they still
00:47:20 talk yeah
00:47:21 or they you put your sleep mats down
00:47:22 there talking you have to lift it back
00:47:24 up and you just have to eventually say i
00:47:25 just don't want to talk
00:47:26 but this one guy sat next to me at my
00:47:28 gate and um
00:47:30 i i feel bad because he heard me talk
00:47:32 about him on whitney's podcast and he
00:47:33 felt really bad
00:47:34 that this happened but whatever but it

00:49:03 to you let's
00:49:04 let's continue this conversation on the
00:49:05 plane so i'm getting on the plane and
00:49:06 i'm like
00:49:07 listen i want to sleep i need to sleep
00:49:09 and i was gonna

00:49:18 so i get on that plane and we we're
00:49:20 chatting we're having like a really good
00:49:22 time he's like funny
00:49:23 and nice and interesting similar
00:49:26 interests
00:49:27 and you know he he lives on the west
00:49:29 coast but i'm like i can move anywhere
00:49:31 like i'm down
00:49:32 let's do this and um and it's it's it's
00:49:35 flirty but it's not
00:49:36 like there's nothing over the top but i
00:49:38 i was just like i kept thinking i didn't
00:49:39 see a ring on his finger
00:49:41 there's no mention of a girlfriend and
00:49:44 then finally
00:49:45 i'm like we need to switch this to like
00:49:47 a flirty kind of we need to talk about
00:49:48 dating or something to get us
00:49:50 in that kind of vein of conversation and
00:49:53 i said something like so have you been
00:49:55 dating during covet and this is two and
00:49:56 a half hours into the flight
00:49:58 and he's like oh well i have a i have a
00:50:00 girlfriend who i live with
00:50:01 and i was just i i almost started crying
00:50:05 because not because i was like oh i'm
00:50:07 this guy
00:50:08 i thought i was gonna be with him but
00:50:10 because i just could have been sleeping
00:50:11 that entire time
00:50:13 and i wasted this i don't want to talk
00:50:16 to anyone well there's no other way to
00:50:18 know
00:50:18 i you could have mentioned her but five
00:50:21 minutes in
00:50:22 well why if he just thought that you
00:50:24 thought that he was a fan
00:50:25 and you he wanted to talk to you if
00:50:27 there's no flirting i just want to talk
00:50:29 to a fan
00:50:30 for that why
00:50:33 maybe just because he's an interesting
00:50:35 person and you're bored how would he
00:50:36 know that you were tired
00:50:38 no it wasn't his fault it wasn't his
00:50:40 fault it was my fault to get my hopes up
00:50:42 but that's too far into a conversation
00:50:45 to not trust
00:50:46 you got you're talking to a girl who you
00:50:48 know is single
00:50:49 you sound like a guy age-appropriate
00:50:52 dude you sound like a girl i do
00:50:53 yeah yeah yeah it's not fair i'm talking
00:50:54 to her for fucking two hours
00:50:57 and then finally she says i have a
00:50:58 boyfriend i live with my shit what the
00:51:00 fuck i bought you three drinks already
00:51:02 yeah
00:51:02 yeah i'm i'm that guy don't waste my
00:51:05 time don't waste my money
00:51:07 if you have a girlfriend it's just it's
00:51:09 i was really
00:51:10 ticked off but he's a fan though you are
00:51:12 a public
00:51:13 person you are a professional what was
00:51:16 going on
00:51:17 but nikki you have fans you sell out
00:51:20 all over the country
00:51:24 it had been many months since i had been
00:51:26 on stage
00:51:27 i've been living with my parents for
00:51:29 four months i forgot who i was
00:51:31 oh that's so funny and i was so i was so
00:51:33 excited i was so sad and
00:51:34 i continued the conversation because
00:51:35 then i go you know what nicky why can't
00:51:37 you just get to know someone
00:51:39 and relationships fail he has a
00:51:41 girlfriend it's not like he's married
00:51:42 like
00:51:43 i'm sorry his kids are going to grow up
00:51:45 they're going to get out of the house
00:51:46 eventually
00:51:47 yes whatever i can wait years
00:51:50 yeah it's no big deal i'll plant that
00:51:52 seed if guys a girlfriend i don't
00:51:53 dig a hole i'm not gonna like outwardly
00:51:56 flirt with a guy
00:51:57 or like try to break up a relationship i
00:52:00 mean
00:52:00 i would never do that but if a guy is a
00:52:02 girlfriend i'll still like have a flirty
00:52:04 conversation
00:52:05 because mostly just conversations most
00:52:08 things don't lie
00:52:09 most well everything doesn't last well
00:52:11 yeah that's true everything
00:52:12 your life but if a guy's married then
00:52:14 i'm like okay
00:52:15 i'm gonna have no hope a story about a
00:52:18 couple
00:52:18 that dated when they were in high school
00:52:21 and then they got married
00:52:23 they married other people broke up the
00:52:26 whole deal
00:52:27 went through lives and then got married
00:52:29 again when they were in their late
00:52:31 70s that is sweet i like that
00:52:34 it's kind of adorable yeah it is kind of
00:52:36 adorable like they decide like well

00:53:33 oh perfectly as we're both looking to
00:53:36 what we're gonna do next
00:53:37 yeah you think it is perfect but he
00:53:38 won't have sex with me what
00:53:40 i know because i think he like is gay
00:53:44 cares about me and like doesn't want to
00:53:47 right upset me because i tend to have
00:53:49 sex with someone and then i get
00:53:51 my hopes up a little bit i mean i got my
00:53:53 hopes up on a plane with a conversation
00:53:55 with the guy i was like planning our
00:53:56 future together
00:53:58 what were you thinking what was like the
00:53:59 ultimate goal like you're seeing the
00:54:00 babies you're seeing the whole thing
00:54:02 no it's just like he was talking about
00:54:03 his family and i was like picturing
00:54:04 meeting them
00:54:05 and he mentioned like moving to san
00:54:06 diego and i was like kind of annoyed
00:54:08 because i'm like we haven't even talked
00:54:09 about san diego yet like
00:54:11 i'm not even joking you mentioned some
00:54:14 things that i'm like
00:54:15 well you don't even know that i want to
00:54:17 go there but i would but he
00:54:18 that's weird that he would just say that
00:54:21 so yeah i mean i
00:54:24 i really do i as soon as i start talking
00:54:26 to a guy i start picturing our future i
00:54:29 picture like
00:54:29 walking down the aisle to him um yeah i
00:54:32 get ahead of myself
00:54:33 well that's maybe that's not the
00:54:34 opposite okay what's your opposite is
00:54:36 like never thinking you're ever going to
00:54:38 be in a relationship and every guy you
00:54:40 talk to
00:54:40 never imagining that it's ever going to
00:54:42 go anywhere
00:54:43 yeah yeah so at least i have some hope
00:54:46 yeah you're hopeful
00:54:46 i do have hope yeah you're hopeful so
00:54:49 this guy
00:54:49 this guy cares about you so he won't
00:54:52 hook up with you
00:54:53 because he doesn't want to get your
00:54:54 hopes up yeah it's really nice because
00:54:56 every time
00:54:57 every time we hung out hang out together
00:54:59 i'm always like
00:55:01 can we please just have sex like i
00:55:03 haven't had sex in
00:55:04 17 months now
00:55:07 it's so long joe you won't just hook you
00:55:09 up
00:55:10 no well we i know it's terrible
00:55:13 i i'm and and and i'm really i mean i
00:55:16 could get laid
00:55:17 it's not a pro like there are guys that
00:55:20 would gladly fuck me but
00:55:22 i i just don't i don't feel comfortable
00:55:24 having random sex i'm not good at it
00:55:26 i need to really like someone and he
00:55:28 just knows how to get it done and we've
00:55:29 done it so many times it just feels like
00:55:31 it would be
00:55:31 so easy yeah but i don't but he's right
00:55:34 i probably would
00:55:36 think oh my god we're going to be
00:55:37 something we're going to get back
00:55:38 together and then my heart would get
00:55:40 broken again so it might not be worth it
00:55:41 but what does he do
00:55:42 he's a um he works in radio he's he's on
00:55:45 he was a pr
00:55:46 producer behind the scenes producer we
00:55:48 met on um a show that i had on mtv
00:55:51 and then we created a show together on
00:55:52 comedy central and then um
00:55:54 and then that show got canceled and then
00:55:56 we got cancelled and then he
00:55:58 uh now he's on the radio in st louis
00:56:00 he's like a broadcaster now
00:56:02 and um yeah so he's a good guy he is a
00:56:05 good guy
00:56:06 thinking about it that way yeah cause
00:56:08 most guys if a girl's like
00:56:09 can we please have sex like um that's it
00:56:12 just sex
00:56:14 yeah that's it yeah and i've said that
00:56:16 before so many times
00:56:17 like that's all i that's all i want i
00:56:19 don't want anything more than
00:56:20 that that's so not true though i you get
00:56:22 to learn men have to learn that that's
00:56:24 not really true
00:56:25 ever um i mean i've only had a couple
00:56:27 times ever in my life
00:56:28 but i was younger and stupid where a
00:56:31 girl said i just want sex but then
00:56:33 after you give it to him they generally
00:56:36 that's not
00:56:36 really the case no because i think women
00:56:38 develop like intimacy bonds with men in
00:56:41 a different way like
00:56:42 like we were talking earlier about um
00:56:44 not that i think i know right
00:56:46 or it's general generalizing but um
00:56:48 we're talking about uh
00:56:50 using like men do not care if you use
00:56:52 them
00:56:53 it means zero like if a woman is like i
00:56:56 just want to use you for sex guys like
00:56:57 okay
00:56:58 yeah like it doesn't it's not there's no
00:57:01 negative connotation
00:57:02 like if if you are walking by a girl
00:57:05 and her friends and she used you for sex
00:57:08 and she tells her friends yeah i fucked
00:57:10 that guy just for the sex
00:57:11 and the guy's there he's like he's not
00:57:14 gonna feel bad but
00:57:15 if a girl walks by and a guy's hanging
00:57:18 out with his friends
00:57:18 i was like yeah i just use her for sex
00:57:21 she's gonna be like
00:57:21 oh she's gonna feel terrible the guy
00:57:24 wouldn't feel bad at all unless he's
00:57:26 really weird
00:57:27 obviously we're generalizing again sure
00:57:29 but most men are not going to have an
00:57:31 issue with that i don't know i just got
00:57:32 kind of horned up when you said
00:57:34 when you when i pictured passing a guy
00:57:36 and someone said i just used her for sex
00:57:38 that kind of was exciting he got excited
00:57:40 about that because he doesn't want
00:57:41 anything
00:57:42 i'm scared of intimacy in a big way so i
00:57:45 do like the idea of just being used and
00:57:48 like oh
00:57:48 someone just doesn't want to get to know
00:57:50 me the problem is
00:57:51 if you get rocked right and it's fun and
00:57:54 you enjoy it and you actually have a
00:57:55 good time like you gotta assume too if
00:57:57 you're having sex with someone you don't
00:57:58 hate them yeah you like them as a person
00:58:00 a problem you have to like someone have
00:58:02 sex with them and then
00:58:03 you have sex with them you just then now
00:58:05 you like them and you had sex
00:58:06 and then here's the other problem if you
00:58:08 like them more
00:58:10 than they like you then you get upset
00:58:12 like a lot of times people
00:58:14 when they get rejected by someone they
00:58:15 feel pain
00:58:17 they feel pain of either being rejected
00:58:19 or neglected and then they associate
00:58:21 that pain with something negative that
00:58:22 the person has done even if they haven't
00:58:24 really done anything negative
00:58:25 and then they get angry at that person
00:58:27 and you're like i didn't do anything
00:58:28 that's why you just abused me for sex
00:58:30 and you're like ah
00:58:32 yep no we had sex
00:58:35 it's not even like i would feel like i
00:58:36 was getting used but i would just be so
00:58:38 disappointed like why don't you want
00:58:40 more with me why wouldn't you want to
00:58:41 marry
00:58:42 why don't you want to spend time with me
00:58:43 all the time why don't you want to be my
00:58:45 man
00:58:46 and um and that's the problem but what
00:58:49 he does do that makes me feel great is
00:58:50 like
00:58:51 i j he always says i want to make it
00:58:53 clear i want to fuck you
00:58:54 so bad you look like he'll tell me all
00:58:56 the things that i need to hear
00:58:58 that essentially just kind of get you
00:59:00 juiced up
00:59:01 yeah like it makes me feel as good as if
00:59:03 i got
00:59:04 dick down okay so he says all the things
00:59:06 i want to but the problem yeah
00:59:08 like you look so good this is what i do
00:59:10 to you this is what i want to do
00:59:12 smash it yes and then i leave feeling
00:59:14 like oh okay
00:59:15 like still good good
00:59:19 he is a good guy and um and i like that
00:59:22 asshole on the fucking plane
00:59:24 no that guy was so good too that poor
00:59:26 guy wrote to me because we exchanged
00:59:27 numbers because like i said
00:59:28 plant that seed his relationship might
00:59:31 fall especially now that you've talked
00:59:32 about on two different podcasts no he's
00:59:34 going to be so
00:59:35 he's going to text me again bob is that
00:59:36 you i know okay
00:59:38 if his girlfriend is listening i just
00:59:40 want to say he did nothing inappropriate
00:59:42 he never flirted with
00:59:43 there was nothing he did that if he were
00:59:44 my boyfriend i'd be like he shouldn't
00:59:46 have done that
00:59:47 so the he behaved like a true gentleman
00:59:50 did not flirt with me i run into it way
00:59:52 too way too much
00:59:54 but i mean what are you gonna do
00:59:58 i don't know what i'm gonna do i'm on
00:59:59 raya i'm on
01:00:01 um rai is a celebrity celebrities right
01:00:05 i like a blue check mark and it's not
01:00:07 because i like guys that are famous
01:00:09 because they're famous and i want to be
01:00:10 famous it has nothing to
01:00:12 maybe it has like a little bit to do
01:00:13 with that i'm not gonna say it has
01:00:14 nothing to do with that
01:00:15 yeah there's something hot about a guy
01:00:18 being extremely successful in other
01:00:20 people thinking that he's cool okay yes
01:00:22 i'll give you that
01:00:23 i think it's because i get i can i can
01:00:26 know them before i go into the date
01:00:28 right i can watch their stuff i i feel
01:00:30 like i've already acquainted with them
01:00:32 that's why i like a blue check mark it
01:00:34 validates like i can get to know you
01:00:35 before i go on a date
01:00:36 i don't like going into these things
01:00:38 blind so that's
01:00:40 that's why i like a blue check but
01:00:42 there's no one in st louis
01:00:43 that's on the goddamn app no one no not
01:00:46 one person
01:00:48 um really honestly no there's no one in
01:00:50 st louis on them

01:01:25 like that's kind of the same you're
01:01:27 addicted to those they have to be
01:01:28 like how many people are having these
01:01:31 random encounters
01:01:33 because of dating apps yeah how many
01:01:35 people are it's like
01:01:36 swiping left which one is good uh right
01:01:39 right is good

01:01:52 left and that means you like them
01:01:55 left means no you're garbage i never
01:01:57 want to see you again and right means

01:02:54 his dog is his best friend or
01:02:57 my mom thinks i'm a catch or you know
01:03:00 some part of his personality is based on
01:03:02 a food he loves
01:03:03 just anything kind of dependable like
01:03:05 that or like i love to get
01:03:07 lost in a good book or just something

01:03:14 for you whenever a guy writes that i'm
01:03:16 just like oh
01:03:18 you're poor i get i mean like you take
01:03:20 me to a restaurant i don't want to watch
01:03:22 you
01:03:22 cook let's just go sit down and i don't
01:03:24 want to watch you have to
01:03:26 like just because you got you know one
01:03:28 of those meal kit delivery services i
01:03:30 have to sit and watch you chop cilantro
01:03:32 and talk about your connection with your
01:03:33 nephew

01:03:58 i don't cook it's not like i'm gonna
01:03:59 take care of that so i guess i

01:04:03 more like a guy who just like
01:04:04 i don't know what i want i'm really this
01:04:07 isn't fair
01:04:08 to anyone i don't know what i want
01:04:11 i want a guy who i already know oh my
01:04:13 god and i can
01:04:14 hang around with and then develop a
01:04:16 crush on and then i decide when we're
01:04:18 going to take it to the next level
01:04:19 you just want to be the boss kind of
01:04:23 i want to be the one to be like okay now
01:04:24 we can even though i
01:04:26 tend to like it when guys make the first
01:04:28 move and kind of are a little bit across
01:04:29 what the fuck you want
01:04:30 i'm all over the place i don't know what
01:04:34 the
01:04:34 fuck i want i got i got a guy
01:04:38 who's crying over here so am i
01:04:42 i just can't nothing can come out i'm
01:04:44 crying
01:04:45 it's not disrespectful laughter no it's
01:04:48 it's
01:04:49 i know it's sad i got a guy right now
01:04:51 who um
01:04:53 he's like a he's a i would say
01:04:56 we're talking an a-lister here yeah one
01:04:59 of my first
01:05:01 not my first but he's definitely he's
01:05:03 definitely up there i've known about him
01:05:04 for years been a fan
01:05:06 and we connected and um he just
01:05:09 wants to sext with me and like
01:05:12 have face time sex and stuff like that
01:05:14 like that's what he's without physical
01:05:16 sex
01:05:16 well he lives in los angeles and i live
01:05:19 in st louis
01:05:20 whenever i'm available or in his area he
01:05:23 doesn't seem to want to meet up
01:05:24 so oh it's just always he checks on him
01:05:28 in on me every couple weeks and it's
01:05:29 just like
01:05:30 have you been intimate with this person
01:05:32 no oh we
01:05:33 met him one time in person and then it
01:05:35 went right to texting
01:05:36 that's that's weird someone who
01:05:40 that's weird i know i don't like it
01:05:41 either i'm like can we hang out in
01:05:43 person
01:05:44 and then maybe i can virtually
01:05:47 jerk you off or whatever you want me to
01:05:50 walk you through whatever it is you're
01:05:53 doing to yourself
01:05:54 um but i mean i just made the mistake of
01:05:56 getting him off one time
01:05:58 when he was texting like he always
01:05:59 texted me at like 3am
01:06:01 oh and he's just like how are you
01:06:03 feeling like just checking in on my
01:06:05 well-being
01:06:06 in the middle of the night and um it's
01:06:10 not it's nice i really do think he like
01:06:12 cares about me but like there's some
01:06:13 kind of
01:06:14 weird and we both have intimacy issues
01:06:16 we've declared that to each other so
01:06:17 something's going
01:06:18 on there and we can't even see each
01:06:19 other i mean i live in st louis with my
01:06:20 parents and
01:06:21 he's in here and um well you're here
01:06:24 right now
01:06:24 i know i didn't let him know i was here
01:06:27 but i just ha
01:06:27 i didn't tell you i'm gonna find out
01:06:31 when you talk about him on this podcast
01:06:33 and millions of people hear about it
01:06:34 no no no no no no no no no no no no
01:06:37 he'll know
01:06:38 he'll know good you're listening aren't
01:06:40 you friends with nikki
01:06:42 yeah she's on the podcast talking about

01:06:46 he's told anyone that we're
01:06:47 friends or texts but he tells one guy

01:08:19 i haven't hooked up in so long yeah but
01:08:23 you're not
01:08:24 you're not around someone yes oh yeah if
01:08:28 i was
01:08:28 around someone yeah like uncomfortable
01:08:31 with that if i had someone to have sex
01:08:32 with i'd be like
01:08:33 your old lazy-eyed lady
01:08:37 from back in the day
01:08:40 i would be getting i would be uh yeah i
01:08:43 can be
01:08:43 i can get addicted to sex pretty quick
01:08:45 when i'm in a relationship and like like
01:08:47 having it it's just an easy way to
01:08:48 tap out and forget your feelings so i
01:08:50 was also part of the book
01:08:52 you're about irresistible it's it even
01:08:54 talks about sex addiction i couldn't
01:08:56 gambling addictions
01:08:57 really get into that book because i got
01:08:58 distracted by my phone again
01:09:00 within three seconds i mean i'm reading
01:09:02 it on my phone as i'm learning that
01:09:04 i'm addicted to my phone yeah that so
01:09:06 that was a part of it was i mean
01:09:08 that's what ever i feel like so many
01:09:10 guys are sex addicts a lot that i deal
01:09:12 with
01:09:12 and like have relationships with or like
01:09:15 communicating with i'm just like oh this
01:09:16 guy's a sex addict
01:09:18 and um and and a lot of them are
01:09:21 famous i think that creates i mean you
01:09:24 can
01:09:24 have sex with anyone you want when
01:09:26 you're famous really really
01:09:28 hot chicks really hot chicks they throw
01:09:31 themselves at you and you become
01:09:32 they're sex you're like the woman you're
01:09:34 the one who's being pursued
01:09:35 oh right yes and so that's the problem
01:09:38 with famous guys is they're constantly
01:09:40 they're they're too busy with like
01:09:42 really really hot chicks constantly
01:09:43 being thrown at them they don't really
01:09:45 need to have a relationship
01:09:46 where the i mean that's the appeal of
01:09:48 having a relationship for a lot of guys
01:09:49 i think is just having a regular person
01:09:51 to have sex with
01:09:52 that's definitely one of it and then
01:09:54 there's also
01:09:56 this uh this book is talking about porn
01:09:58 addicts
01:09:59 and gambling addicts and and then it's
01:10:02 really all the same thing
01:10:04 it's like your body and your brain gets
01:10:06 fixated on particular activities and
01:10:09 those particular activities
01:10:10 occupy your mind so much and then it
01:10:13 becomes a detriment to your life
01:10:15 and it's with video games with sex it's
01:10:18 with porn it's with gambling
01:10:20 it's with drugs and that they used to
01:10:22 think that they're different things
01:10:24 these things and obviously drugs have
01:10:27 like physical consequences like heroin
01:10:29 and you know and alcohol like alcohol is
01:10:31 one of the worst to get off of
01:10:32 because when you get off of alcoholic
01:10:34 people who are like legitimate
01:10:35 alcoholics
01:10:36 they can die oh yeah called amy
01:10:38 winehouse that's
01:10:39 how she died no bulimia i don't know if
01:10:42 that's
01:10:42 no one talks about it well let's let's
01:10:44 google that look it up because her
01:10:46 documentary she was
01:10:48 puking her brains out at the end and
01:10:50 that can cause cardiac arrest like that
01:10:53 and so i think i mean it could have been
01:10:55 a mixture of both but
01:10:57 i i do think her bulimia had a huge i
01:10:59 listened to
01:11:00 fucking her shit so often she's uh on
01:11:04 my like regular playlist she's in so
01:11:06 much pain you can hear it in her voice
01:11:08 it was such a beautiful voice it's an
01:11:10 interesting voice
01:11:11 even when she's thinking about going to
01:11:12 rehab you know anyone was killed by
01:11:15 bulimia not drugs says her brother
01:11:17 yeah drink and drugs took their toll but
01:11:20 eating disorder fatally weakened amy
01:11:22 yeah dude how does some serious shit
01:11:24 what is the um
01:11:27 what is the uh the coroner's result
01:11:29 though
01:11:30 did they say the thing is a brother yeah
01:11:33 no i just think that that gets swept
01:11:36 under the table so much
01:11:38 eating disorders when really that is
01:11:41 and you know kovit is killing a lot of
01:11:43 people with eating disorders too people
01:11:45 that on the other
01:11:46 side of that food addicts who can't stop
01:11:49 eating and
01:11:49 obesity makes you so much more
01:11:52 susceptible
01:11:54 to covet i mean i yeah i think i'd only
01:11:57 know that because i've
01:11:58 you know dabbled in all of those things
01:12:00 before and um
01:12:01 it's terrible yeah i'm a definite addict
01:12:04 and i gotta watch it but this the sex
01:12:06 addict thing i mean
01:12:07 i just think that that's one that's
01:12:08 unchecked for so many people yeah and so
01:12:10 acceptable
01:12:12 and um porn addiction i mean i
01:12:15 i can't get off without watching porn
01:12:17 you can't get off at all without
01:12:18 watching porn
01:12:19 not even close i wouldn't even try if my
01:12:21 internet was down
01:12:22 we we had a power outage the other day
01:12:24 at my house and it was just like okay
01:12:25 well that's
01:12:26 i would be screwed without i couldn't do
01:12:29 it i mean i would figure out a way i
01:12:30 think i would
01:12:32 manage but if my if my toys aren't
01:12:34 working and aren't plugged in
01:12:36 and if i don't have porn i'm just not
01:12:37 getting off i've never been someone who
01:12:38 can do it manually
01:12:39 and and with my imagination it's really
01:12:41 a problem because the porn i watch is
01:12:43 like
01:12:44 not good what kind
01:12:48 joe
01:13:02 yeah really i mean i got a threat on um
01:13:05 like a dm from just some fucking troll
01:13:08 a while back that was like if i put out
01:13:10 a hit on the dark web for you to be
01:13:12 gang raped and asked paid the guys a
01:13:14 hundred thousand dollars to do it
01:13:16 i could make that happen and you know
01:13:18 someone would accept that and i was like
01:13:21 joke's on you that that's my fantasy
01:13:26 i don't really mean that please do not
01:13:27 do that but i was also like
01:13:29 no that's i'm not joking like that tends
01:13:32 to be the stuff that i watch is like
01:13:34 really aggressive gang bangs and like
01:13:36 women tied up i i
01:13:38 i pay for my porn because i feel so bad
01:13:40 what's happening to the women in it i
01:13:41 hope that they are being compensated for
01:13:43 it
01:13:44 so i pay like 30 bucks a month for
01:13:45 kink.com i'm watching
01:13:48 really fucked up stuff um and
01:13:51 i've always been been into like being
01:13:54 tied up and like
01:13:55 i i'm someone who doesn't feel like i
01:13:57 deserve
01:13:58 pleasure without like having pain like i
01:14:00 don't ever
01:14:01 celebrate anything and i can only
01:14:02 celebrate or like relax
01:14:04 if i put in so much work that i'm just
01:14:06 like dead so i can
01:14:08 it's really hard for me to like enjoy
01:14:10 myself in life i always have to have
01:14:12 it's i have to punish myself first and
01:14:14 so orgasms are not something that like i
01:14:17 feel
01:14:18 i feel it's hard for me to give myself
01:14:20 one and let myself have that much
01:14:22 it's like it's too much it's like
01:14:23 christmas you're like you have to wait a
01:14:25 year for christmas you can't give
01:14:26 yourself christmas every day
01:14:28 so i feel i like to be tied up and like
01:14:31 forced to have christmas
01:14:32 and like i jesus christ that's what i
01:14:35 that's what i tend to like it's like
01:14:37 you have to do this and because i'm so i
01:14:39 don't like losing control
01:14:40 either and the orgasm is like the most
01:14:43 you can lose control i just feel like
01:14:46 i don't i don't like being that out of
01:14:47 control and i don't know what's gonna
01:14:49 happen i'm scared i'm just gonna like
01:14:51 shit everywhere or something like i'm
01:14:52 totally scared of shitting everywhere
01:14:56 i am is no one else scared of that
01:15:00 no when they come i don't think i've
01:15:02 never
01:15:03 shit everywhere or saying something that
01:15:05 you regret or like
01:15:06 just do it i don't know having a kramer
01:15:09 moment when i'm just kidding
01:15:10 no just i'm terrified of what might
01:15:13 happen that's why i only have sex with
01:15:14 people that i like trust so much so that
01:15:16 if i shit on them they wouldn't i know
01:15:18 that
01:15:18 that guy wouldn't hate me right and like
01:15:20 wouldn't tell people
01:15:21 and that's why you're willing to let
01:15:23 them tie you up you trust them so much
01:15:25 because if they tie me up and i shit
01:15:27 okay okay that's my biggest fear
01:15:30 yeah it wasn't my fault you tied me up i
01:15:33 had no choice
01:15:34 oh my god or um yeah so if if you're
01:15:37 forced then
01:15:38 you have you have yeah you then it's not
01:15:41 your fault what you did
01:15:42 or what you said so do you ever watch
01:15:44 regular porn or is it always
01:15:46 like no never it's always i started
01:15:48 kinked i go to kink.com
01:15:50 i go to anal i go to bondage i go to
01:15:52 gangbangs
01:15:53 my problem is i do not like the women to
01:15:56 be abused i don't but you can't find
01:15:58 gangbangs where the woman's being
01:15:59 treated nicely
01:16:00 you can't find one where they're just
01:16:01 like good job
01:16:03 you're taking on so much like i've
01:16:06 talked about this in my special but i
01:16:08 i thought after talking about in my
01:16:09 special and saying can i please get a
01:16:10 respectful gangbang
01:16:12 porn would listen and heed my request
01:16:14 and make her bang gangbang when they're
01:16:16 just like
01:16:16 they're proud of her for her you know
01:16:19 tenacity
01:16:20 and her strength during this really
01:16:23 arduous
01:16:24 journey personal journey and they're
01:16:27 never nice to her they're always calling
01:16:28 her a dumb bitch they're making her oink
01:16:30 like a pig they have a
01:16:31 fucking boot on her head they spit in
01:16:33 her face and i
01:16:34 honestly joe i'm not kidding you i watch
01:16:36 porn with half the screen covered up
01:16:38 because i don't like what they do to her
01:16:39 head
01:16:39 but i like what they're doing to to the
01:16:41 rest of her because i i just it's too
01:16:43 they're so mean
01:16:45 you know choking her like doing a fish
01:16:47 hook i don't like any of that but i like
01:16:49 i like the idea of gangbangs i like the
01:16:51 idea of a girl being like kind of
01:16:52 used and taken advantage of um and i i
01:16:55 do feel guilty about all this because
01:16:57 i'm a feminist obviously i
01:16:58 love women and i want us to feel
01:17:00 empowered and i'm so sad for these women
01:17:02 but that's what gets me off like
01:17:05 what a conundrum yeah i don't want to be
01:17:08 fisted joe
01:17:10 but that's all that gets me off is
01:17:12 watching women get fisted
01:17:16 i like that now and i don't have any
01:17:19 interest in being
01:17:20 having that done to me why do you like
01:17:21 or so i say why
01:17:22 [Laughter]
01:17:27 oh my god
01:17:33 i don't know what i'm even saying but
01:17:34 yeah dude i'm watching i'm crying i'm
01:17:36 watching like
01:17:37 it just it just is a slippery slope dude
01:17:40 it just
01:17:41 gets you know it you go from just like
01:17:44 slight bondage where a girl's tied up
01:17:46 and a guy's maybe like
01:17:47 doing some stuff to her with a a wand
01:17:50 and like
01:17:51 fingering her and choking her a little
01:17:53 bit and then it's
01:17:55 it's just like seven guys
01:17:58 writing pig on a girl's head and making
01:18:00 her oink
01:18:02 and like and and spitting on her you
01:18:05 bookmark those
01:18:06 i mean i have i have a file i have a
01:18:10 i have an email that i sent to myself
01:18:12 it's called porn i like and i just keep
01:18:14 sending myself the next
01:18:15 anytime i come from a video i send it to
01:18:17 myself so i can go back and i can also
01:18:19 see
01:18:20 my my descendants into depravity
01:18:23 through the years i can see where i
01:18:25 started and where i'm at and how it
01:18:26 happened how long does this
01:18:28 email change it's been going on since
01:18:30 2017 is when i started it so i have a
01:18:32 a good backlog of but but what i like
01:18:35 about this is that usually the girl
01:18:37 is i don't like to see a girl in
01:18:39 distress i don't like to as soon as she
01:18:41 i think that she's not having a good
01:18:43 time i get out of it
01:18:45 because a lot of these girls are having
01:18:47 a good time they like to be
01:18:49 pushed to the the limit one of my
01:18:51 favorite porn actresses and i just want
01:18:53 to give her a shout out because she does
01:18:54 brilliant work is kristin scott and
01:18:56 one of her the best videos is called
01:18:59 school of seduction
01:19:01 i think that's what it's called and um
01:19:03 or no oh fuck what is it called
01:19:05 it's there's like this academic academy
01:19:07 that these girls go to where they learn
01:19:09 to be sluts
01:19:10 [Laughter]
01:19:12 and they have to like graduate and
01:19:13 there's like five days where they go to
01:19:15 the school
01:19:16 and they're tied up and they're just
01:19:17 like fucked by a bunch of people and
01:19:19 they're made to like plank and get
01:19:21 fucked at the same time as they're
01:19:22 planking
01:19:23 and it's just like they're they get they
01:19:26 just
01:19:26 they have to do what you say when
01:19:28 someone tells you you have to do
01:19:29 something you have to be like oh i guess
01:19:30 i have to do it it's not my fault that
01:19:32 i'm a whore
01:19:32 and they i just like that that's what
01:19:35 i'm into
01:19:36 because i think i have so much guilt
01:19:37 associated with wanting to be sexual or
01:19:40 wanting to feel sexual that if someone's
01:19:41 making me do it then suddenly
01:19:43 it's not my fault so do you think that's
01:19:45 why you like bondage and gangbangs
01:19:47 because it's out of the person's control
01:19:49 yeah yeah and i was looking into like
01:19:51 because i was feeling guilty about
01:19:52 having like
01:19:53 i don't have rape fantasies i don't have
01:19:55 that but a lot of women do
01:19:56 so many women do and it's actually
01:19:58 called uh it's not a rape fantasy
01:20:00 because
01:20:01 you're not fantasizing about actually
01:20:02 being raped because that's
01:20:04 not consensual you want consensual no
01:20:06 it's called
01:20:07 cnc consensual non-consent that's what
01:20:09 it's called and i'm kind of into that
01:20:12 it's um that's an interesting phrase
01:20:15 consensual non-consent i know it's kind
01:20:17 of murky
01:20:18 but saying rape fantasy is just not
01:20:21 uh right you don't want to be raped by
01:20:22 someone you don't want to have sex with
01:20:25 you want to be raped by someone you're
01:20:27 really attracted to but you want to give
01:20:29 in to it so you want it to happen so
01:20:31 it's
01:20:31 it's sort of kind of rape but not really
01:20:33 great because you actually want it to
01:20:35 happen
01:20:35 you want it to mimic you want it to be
01:20:38 like role-playing
01:20:39 rape so but you could stop it at any
01:20:41 time because you have a safe word and
01:20:43 you have all these things but
01:20:44 so it's it isn't rape so women that go i
01:20:46 have a rape fantasy and think that's
01:20:48 like quirky about themselves you don't
01:20:49 you really don't you don't want that
01:20:51 no one wants that um and so
01:20:54 yeah that's what it's called is um
01:20:56 consensual non-consent is what so many
01:20:58 women are into
01:21:00 and i i read about it on reddit because
01:21:01 i i'm in the subreddit sex and it's just
01:21:03 a very common thing that that that women
01:21:05 want in bed
01:21:06 women like to be choked they like to be
01:21:08 bossed around they like their hair
01:21:09 pulled they like
01:21:10 you know but they only like it to be
01:21:12 done by people they want it to be done
01:21:14 yes yes i want to make that very clear
01:21:17 yeah yeah although there are some times
01:21:21 that i
01:21:22 and i there are some times that you know
01:21:25 in some of these porns where the guy is
01:21:27 like i'm not attracted to him
01:21:28 and i wouldn't want his dick inside me
01:21:30 but i definitely like when they
01:21:31 they treat you like a car they're
01:21:33 working on and they just like use tools
01:21:34 on you
01:21:35 and there's no dicks involved that
01:21:37 appeals to me
01:21:38 that's a very popular one like if there
01:21:41 was a place you could go like a body
01:21:42 shop
01:21:43 and just get worked on yep i would love
01:21:45 it
01:21:46 if there was a place you could go where
01:21:49 guys would just massage your vagina and
01:21:52 use tools on you
01:21:53 and you'd be totally down with that yeah
01:21:55 as long as there's no cameras and no one
01:21:57 would ever talk about that i was there i
01:21:58 mean i'd be talking about it on here the
01:22:00 next week but
01:22:02 as long as it was up to me you could
01:22:03 wear a mask and and your sleep mask is
01:22:05 good
01:22:06 you can wear both masks okay yeah and
01:22:08 just lay there and have them meet you
01:22:10 out

01:22:13 want the mouth
01:22:14 maybe i don't know maybe you have to go

01:22:25 they're like dildos and toys are
01:22:28 like amazing i like a wand and i don't i

01:22:38 want something else too

01:22:42 i don't but what's the longest time
01:22:44 you've taken without any masturbation or
01:22:46 sex oh
01:22:47 months and months i can go months months
01:22:50 without masturbating like it does not
01:22:52 but when i get hooked on it like it's
01:22:54 the same way i abstain from pot like
01:22:56 right now i've gone 12 days but if i
01:22:58 sparked one up right now i'd be doing
01:23:00 all the time until i
01:23:02 i go cold turkey and i just i quit so i
01:23:04 can i went a really long time
01:23:06 um without it um during the quarantine
01:23:09 and then i haven't hooked up with i
01:23:11 haven't had sex since
01:23:12 for you know a year and a half at this
01:23:15 point
01:23:16 and um and and i've hooked up a couple
01:23:20 times
01:23:20 in that in that time with guys but i've
01:23:23 always stopped it before i've even
01:23:26 had like been even close i i just knew i
01:23:29 wasn't gonna come so i was just like
01:23:30 just let's stop
01:23:31 when you were talking about like gang
01:23:33 bangs and stuff
01:23:34 your hands you had like a death grip on
01:23:37 your knuckles and you like
01:23:39 bringing your hands back and forth
01:23:41 you're going over in your head i'm like
01:23:42 jesus
01:23:43 oh my god i know i get really intense
01:23:46 about it
01:23:46 yeah you were very intense about it yeah
01:23:48 i'm sure it's it's
01:23:50 because i well i feel really bad even
01:23:53 admitting that that's
01:23:54 what i'm into wow you shouldn't feel bad
01:23:56 that's what you're into
01:23:57 so you're not a bad person you're a good
01:24:00 person thank you
01:24:02 shit but that's okay i'm not the only
01:24:05 one
01:24:05 oh there's a website yeah kink.com is
01:24:08 not supported by nikki glazer alone
01:24:12 it's like there was a chart it's like
01:24:13 look it's it's all nigga
01:24:15 and we thought we had subscribers this
01:24:17 one ladies
01:24:18 she's out of her fucking mind like
01:24:20 there's a whole industry based around
01:24:21 this one broad
01:24:22 they got to make more too because i am
01:24:24 running out of videos to watch because
01:24:25 it's hard for me to go back and watch
01:24:26 old ones so i've been going back and
01:24:29 uh going because they've been around
01:24:30 forever and i i went back like you know
01:24:32 68 pages and there's stuff from like
01:24:34 pre-911 i'm like i can't watch this
01:24:37 woman
01:24:37 from 2000 take on 60 years later now
01:24:41 yeah because i just picture her now like
01:24:43 where where did her life take her
01:24:45 that's the problem right so you think
01:24:46 about what happened to them that allowed
01:24:49 them to be that person in the gang bang
01:24:51 with pig written on their face yeah
01:24:53 that's the problem that's the problem
01:24:54 and that's why a lot of videos on on
01:24:56 kink.com have a pre-interview and a post
01:24:58 interview
01:24:59 so you see the girl go i'm really
01:25:01 looking forward to this gangbang today
01:25:03 i've wanted to do this for so long it's
01:25:05 been a goal of mine
01:25:07 i'm really into this i don't like this
01:25:09 you know you see them consent to all of
01:25:11 it and then happens and then they have
01:25:12 the post one
01:25:13 where they're like shivering in a towel
01:25:15 with like wiping pig off their forehead
01:25:18 and they're like that was fun and you
01:25:21 see them
01:25:21 and there's always a post interview to
01:25:23 you know prove they survived
01:25:27 rough do you get criticized for talking
01:25:30 about this stuff
01:25:31 like by other women i will after this
01:25:35 for sure but no generally not because i
01:25:38 think i'm not alone
01:25:40 with this one you think why do you think
01:25:42 you will with this one because you just
01:25:44 you got really deep into it um
01:25:48 just because you have a bigger audience
01:25:51 more people are going to hear it that's
01:25:52 why and i think you're not alone and i
01:25:54 think there's probably a lot of women
01:25:56 that are listening to this right now
01:25:57 that go
01:25:57 yes same yeah same i just tend to with
01:26:01 my addictions i tend to go
01:26:03 from they get they get bad quickly like
01:26:06 they
01:26:06 so they start off so yeah these are all
01:26:09 progressive
01:26:10 things like eventually you'll get there
01:26:13 with porn if you watch it
01:26:14 long enough it might take someone else
01:26:16 thousands of years to get where i got
01:26:18 in a shorter amount of time but it all
01:26:20 is leading to
01:26:22 i mean it gets gross that's why these
01:26:24 things exist like
01:26:25 you don't start off liking like a woman
01:26:29 with a boot on her head like that's not
01:26:30 something that like
01:26:31 you go to you just slide there
01:26:33 eventually well that's the thing about
01:26:35 porn
01:26:36 in general if you go back and watch old
01:26:38 porn
01:26:39 old porn was just people on dates
01:26:41 [Laughter]
01:26:43 it was if you go back and watch like
01:26:46 porn
01:26:47 you know like from the 80s it's
01:26:49 basically
01:26:50 two people are hanging out and the ones
01:26:52 like i'm just so tense
01:26:54 i've got such a headache and the guy's
01:26:55 like hey let me rub your nick and
01:26:57 rub in the neck and it's like oh that
01:26:58 feels so good it feels so i'm so hot i
01:27:01 need to take my shirt off
01:27:02 and they take their shirt off and then
01:27:04 they start making out and then
01:27:07 yeah i mean it was basically nothing for
01:27:09 me now yeah
01:27:10 but that's what it is it's like it's
01:27:12 basically just people having sex
01:27:14 normal people in normal situations and
01:27:17 then
01:27:18 there's something about where people
01:27:20 need to escalate
01:27:22 the everything has to like okay i've
01:27:24 seen that now i need to see more
01:27:26 and that's what points to the fact that
01:27:28 it's um
01:27:29 that it's an addiction yeah you know
01:27:32 i've never been into anything other than
01:27:35 just sex
01:27:36 that's so good yeah luckily yeah the
01:27:38 only porn that i've ever watched
01:27:40 it's just girls with big asses oh just
01:27:43 sexy girls yeah
01:27:44 i'd say
01:27:49 i've never never been into any of that
01:27:52 no choking nothing it gets so weird joe
01:27:55 it is weird there's so much but i'm not
01:27:58 choking in real life either i've never
01:28:01 never been into that anyway yeah i don't
01:28:04 know why guys are into it i don't relate
01:28:06 to
01:28:07 i don't know that i'd want a guy to like
01:28:10 want to do that to me it's dangerous
01:28:12 yeah yeah but because if you escalate so
01:28:15 think about the escalation in porn well
01:28:17 what if a guy
01:28:18 is into choking girls and then he gets
01:28:20 bored with just regular chokes no it's
01:28:21 like i want to use a rope
01:28:22 like i promise i'm not going to hurt you
01:28:24 i'm just going to use a rope now i want
01:28:25 to
01:28:26 what if it's just like a wire yeah like
01:28:28 i'm not going to make a little mark on
01:28:29 you
01:28:30 okay what if i blindfold what if i hit
01:28:32 you like and then
01:28:33 things get weird what if i murder yeah
01:28:36 and then it releases i mean that
01:28:37 i was watching that golden state killer
01:28:39 documentary and that's what that guy did
01:28:40 he started just doing break-ins and then
01:28:42 that wasn't really itching at the
01:28:44 scratch anymore scratching the itch
01:28:45 anymore
01:28:46 then he moved on to rapes and that was
01:28:49 doing good for a while and then
01:28:50 slowly he started murdering like it
01:28:52 didn't just start out murder you saw his
01:28:54 progression it's like
01:28:55 it yeah this stuff can get really scary
01:28:57 i mean i like being
01:28:59 i think being choked is nice because i
01:29:01 mean you were talking about it with
01:29:02 david blaine yesterday like
01:29:03 it feels good to like lose consciousness
01:29:05 and like come out of it
01:29:07 and be pushed to that brink of like
01:29:10 there's something
01:29:11 uh euphoric about it yeah i think
01:29:13 there's the euphoric thing about getting
01:29:15 choked out
01:29:16 is like as the brain like rushes back to
01:29:18 consciousness
01:29:19 there's probably a bunch of hormones and
01:29:21 things that are just floating around in
01:29:23 there they get fired
01:29:24 up and also like there's there's like
01:29:26 dopamine
01:29:27 and all sorts of spikes that's the other
01:29:29 thing that they were talking about in
01:29:30 this book
01:29:31 uh irresistible talking about the
01:29:33 dopamine rush
01:29:35 that people get from various addictions
01:29:37 and
01:29:38 they were talking about parkinson's
01:29:39 drugs that that this is really
01:29:41 interesting
01:29:42 because uh parkinson's medication
01:29:44 apparently what it does is it spikes
01:29:46 dopamine and it also it it has a lot of
01:29:50 really weird side effects like people
01:29:51 get addicted to gambling
01:29:53 they get addicted they give away all
01:29:54 their stuff
01:29:56 there was a there's a drug called
01:29:58 re-equip
01:29:59 and galaxo smith quan klein
01:30:02 wound up paying this guy somewhere in
01:30:05 the equivalent of like six hundred
01:30:06 thousand dollars because he was a
01:30:08 straight
01:30:08 heterosexual man with no problems with
01:30:11 gambling
01:30:12 and he had parkinson's and he got on
01:30:14 this re-equipped drug
01:30:15 and he became a gay sex and gambling
01:30:18 addict
01:30:18 and he started having risky gay sex like
01:30:21 really risky like he would contact
01:30:23 people on craigslist and meeting
01:30:25 ally and he was just gambling all his
01:30:27 money away
01:30:28 but so much so that he won in court
01:30:32 suing them because conceiving google the
01:30:35 story it's
01:30:36 re-equip and um the man
01:30:39 i believe he's from ireland and he won
01:30:42 in court
01:30:43 because he's like he wasn't a gay man
01:30:45 he's a straight man
01:30:47 right right i mean i never even thought
01:30:50 about it before
01:30:51 you know and then he became a gay sex
01:30:54 and gambling addict
01:30:55 i had him in my act for a while right i
01:30:58 had the the story in my act for a while
01:31:00 like
01:31:00 because apparently he would like like
01:31:02 snap out of it like in the middle of
01:31:04 doing stuff
01:31:06 parkinson's patient wins lawsuit over
01:31:08 gay sex addiction
01:31:10 a french man who also is french see i
01:31:13 don't trust french
01:31:15 at his name didier that's too close to
01:31:17 diddler
01:31:18 right here 52 of nantes france sued the
01:31:22 pharmaceutical giant galaxy smith cline
01:31:25 2011
01:31:26 claiming the drug we re-equip caused him
01:31:29 to lose 82
01:31:30 000 euros gambling on the internet he
01:31:32 said he also became addicted to gay sex
01:31:34 and risky sexual encounters he said he
01:31:36 was raped
01:31:37 after starting the drug in 2003 and
01:31:40 attempted suicide
01:31:42 it's a great day jumber who was
01:31:45 accompanied by his wife during the
01:31:46 emotional ruling told the french
01:31:48 press agency it's been a seven year
01:31:50 battle with our limited means for
01:31:52 recognition of the fact that galaxy
01:31:54 smith klein lied to us
01:31:56 and shattered our lives parkinson's
01:31:58 disease destroys neurons deep within the
01:32:00 brain that releases the feel-good
01:32:02 neurotransmitter dopamine re-equip
01:32:04 belongs to a class of drugs called
01:32:05 dopamine antagonist
01:32:07 or agonists that relieve parkinson's
01:32:10 symptoms such as
01:32:12 shaking stiffness slowly slowness and
01:32:14 trouble balancing by activating dopamine
01:32:16 receptors but the drug has
01:32:18 drugs have side effects that while rare
01:32:20 can be serious
01:32:21 yeah but it's weird things like even if
01:32:24 you have the urge to do it
01:32:26 you are not in control of your own
01:32:28 actions when you
01:32:29 gotta take re-quip finally give me some
01:32:32 just give
01:32:32 permission to do some stuff that i've
01:32:34 always wanted to do
01:32:36 to have an excuse i wonder if it works
01:32:39 on people who
01:32:40 don't have uh parkinson's like what does
01:32:42 it do to people who don't have
01:32:44 parkinson's
01:32:45 right i mean that's terrifying and you
01:32:47 will you i would always hear that in the
01:32:49 side effects of drugs like if you
01:32:51 have are suddenly gambling out of
01:32:53 nowhere and you're like what is that
01:32:55 this is a drug for heartburn and if i'm
01:32:58 gonna start
01:32:59 gambling out of nowhere come on but it's
01:33:01 totally it's scary these drugs i mean
01:33:04 that i'm trying to get on a new
01:33:05 antidepressant because i've just been so
01:33:08 just i'm tired of having these low lows
01:33:10 that just don't
01:33:11 aren't necessary and are just scary
01:33:13 sometimes because the things i think
01:33:16 and the things i i just have these
01:33:18 thoughts that come in that can't stop
01:33:20 and they just can't work i can't be
01:33:21 funny when i'm depressed
01:33:23 so i got to get back on something but
01:33:24 i'm so scared of all these weird side
01:33:26 effects
01:33:27 and the things that um it might make me
01:33:29 do
01:33:30 rightly so and so i mean how long have
01:33:33 you been on antidepressants i mean i was
01:33:34 on them for years and years
01:33:36 um ever since i was like i i
01:33:39 got anorexic when i was like 18 and then
01:33:41 i was so depressed from that because it
01:33:43 just like starts eating your brain
01:33:44 that i got on stuff and then ever since
01:33:46 then i've been i've struggled with
01:33:48 depression i think even before then i
01:33:49 was
01:33:50 a really depressed kid i look at
01:33:51 pictures and i'm just like staring
01:33:53 despondently into a corner
01:33:55 like on holidays i'm like oh i was just
01:33:56 depressed and so
01:33:59 now i'm looking into maybe having adhd
01:34:01 because it's often misdiagnosed in women
01:34:03 because
01:34:04 women don't really have the
01:34:05 hyperactivity part of it and it just
01:34:07 makes us kind of
01:34:08 depressed and have low self-esteem and
01:34:12 messy and all the things that i am that
01:34:14 you worry though about
01:34:16 like messing with your brain chemistry
01:34:18 with these drugs
01:34:19 that like maybe they don't have the
01:34:21 right stuff that they're giving you and
01:34:22 it might be causing
01:34:24 other problems or exacerbating the
01:34:26 current ones no because i've been off
01:34:28 them for a
01:34:29 while now and how long you been off him
01:34:31 um
01:34:32 for a couple months so you're not on
01:34:34 anything and i've been gone through
01:34:35 years of not being on stuff are you just
01:34:37 exercising yeah every day what do you do
01:34:39 i run four miles a day
01:34:41 okay so you're getting a lot of exercise
01:34:42 yeah i do i try to exercise a lot and
01:34:45 but it's still fucking with you and i
01:34:46 eat healthy yeah man i just get all of a
01:34:49 sudden i just get these
01:34:50 fucking thoughts that come in and then
01:34:52 i'm depressed for like four days
01:34:54 so badly that i just i'm i i could file
01:34:57 for disability
01:34:58 as a comedian because i cannot be funny
01:35:00 i can't my
01:35:01 brain doesn't work you can file for

01:35:29 oh today no i've been in a good place
01:35:31 since saturday i woke up on saturday and
01:35:33 i snapped out of it but
01:35:34 you know when i sent out that tweet the
01:35:35 tweet that led to me even being here
01:35:38 was because i was just suffering
01:35:42 for like four or five days with like
01:35:44 really bad depression where
01:35:46 you know i called gary goldman do you
01:35:48 know what he went through yeah he's been
01:35:50 through like serious serious depression
01:35:51 i was i i had a text drafted neil
01:35:54 brennan i wanted to talk to other guys
01:35:55 that like
01:35:56 have had to have had to go places and
01:36:00 little actually did ketamine therapy i
01:36:02 know yeah
01:36:03 he told me he was wild he said he went
01:36:05 to a doctor
01:36:06 they you know they put you in a chair
01:36:08 like a regular doctor's chair
01:36:10 and they induce you into a psychedelic
01:36:13 state
01:36:13 he goes and i mean i was tripping balls
01:36:17 i go really he goes yeah i went to the
01:36:19 doctor's office and they give you
01:36:20 fucking ketamine
01:36:22 and you trip balls and i'm like did it
01:36:23 help you he goes yeah he goes yeah it
01:36:26 helped
01:36:26 ketamine apparently has a big effect on
01:36:30 people that are
01:36:31 uh depressed and some people are taking
01:36:33 it into like a spray
01:36:35 like a mist i don't know if it's nasal
01:36:37 spray
01:36:38 yeah yeah just like a body splash
01:36:40 fucking whitney has something like that
01:36:41 oh yeah i i mean it's just i don't think
01:36:44 it's a body spot
01:36:46 you just like spray it in front of you
01:36:47 and walk through it those are your mouth
01:36:50 okay ketamine mist like a very low dose
01:36:53 of ketamine like a
01:36:54 micro dose of ketamine well i'm gonna
01:36:56 talk to him about it too but
01:36:58 it's so funny because when i when i'm in
01:37:00 it i'm so in it and then when i'm out of
01:37:01 it i just forget that it can get that
01:37:03 bad and i don't even
01:37:04 think about it i forget that it can get
01:37:06 so bad but and there's no triggers that
01:37:08 are making it bad or good you know right
01:37:10 now like things are really
01:37:11 not like i are very uncertain my career
01:37:14 is going great by all
01:37:16 you know if you were yeah by all
01:37:18 indications i should not be depressed
01:37:20 like
01:37:21 i have a loving family i have my health
01:37:23 but you say
01:37:24 your career is going great but
01:37:26 everyone's career hit a wall
01:37:27 yeah all of us that are comics we hit a
01:37:30 wall yeah and mark the only one who's
01:37:31 touring regularly is bert
01:37:32 i know he's depressed right now he's
01:37:35 fucking told you
01:37:36 told me he just did 19 shows or 15 shows
01:37:38 in nine days
01:37:39 he goes i'm fucking exhausted i got to
01:37:41 stop and he goes in his agency's trying
01:37:42 to push him to
01:37:43 organize a summer tour or a fall tour
01:37:45 now and i really i relate to i think
01:37:47 that bert is
01:37:48 a lot like me that if he does stop and
01:37:50 stops working
01:37:51 yeah it will be so much worse than it
01:37:54 was he'll freak out and you know he
01:37:56 loves to drink too
01:37:57 yeah you know bert's got a lot of
01:37:59 different things that he's
01:38:00 sort of kind of whatever
01:38:03 is going on in his head that he's trying
01:38:05 to squash
01:38:07 he does it with a lot of different
01:38:08 things whether he works a lot or he just
01:38:11 i mean he tours and when he tours he
01:38:12 tours burt will tour in a bus
01:38:15 and hit a different place every night
01:38:17 and then it used to be that you would
01:38:19 invite people to go out and drink with
01:38:21 them
01:38:21 yeah he has this expectation to fulfill
01:38:24 as the the party animal
01:38:25 and so he is always i mean i feel for
01:38:28 him always
01:38:29 having to to be on and be that guy and
01:38:31 be shirtless and be down to party
01:38:34 well he was doing a special and they
01:38:36 were handing him shots and he was like i
01:38:37 can't do shots i'm doing my special
01:38:39 right
01:38:40 and they're like fuck you drink he's
01:38:43 like you're ruining my special
01:38:44 oh my goodness like i'm filming a
01:38:46 special here this is for fucking netflix
01:38:47 you idiots
01:38:48 yeah what are you doing he was mad but
01:38:50 if he's but there's part of me that goes
01:38:52 maybe he should be fucked up if he's
01:38:54 done
01:38:54 all of the preparation for this fucking
01:38:56 he's been fucked up
01:38:58 right why the night you tape your
01:38:59 special would you do things differently
01:39:01 yeah i don't do anything differently
01:39:03 when i tape specials do you
01:39:06 get depressed no you you never felt that
01:39:09 i mean maybe like very low level
01:39:11 depression yeah that's great
01:39:12 yeah because i don't work out like a
01:39:14 terrorist i know
01:39:16 and what is that about i think i'm
01:39:19 very primitive i think my brain like
01:39:22 my genetics i think i come from a long
01:39:26 line of savages
01:39:27 and i think the only way i feel good
01:39:30 really feel good is to do
01:39:32 very violent things yeah yeah push
01:39:34 yourself
01:39:35 i need to i run hills i beat the fuck
01:39:38 out of a heavy bag
01:39:40 but do you enjoy it in the room in the
01:39:41 middle of it you're actually loving
01:39:44 fucking love pushing yourself love it
01:39:46 but then how much do you love it when
01:39:47 you're done i mean isn't that the best
01:39:49 feeling i enjoy it while i'm doing it
01:39:52 but i get to a place where i don't enjoy
01:39:54 it
01:39:54 yeah that's i have to hit that place you
01:39:56 have to push yourself
01:39:57 yeah i don't i don't work out to like
01:40:00 where oh it feels pretty good
01:40:01 like there's none of that i want to see
01:40:03 you like
01:40:04 walking a mall someday like doing a
01:40:06 gentle mall
01:40:11 suit with tiny little weight hand
01:40:13 weights walk with my dog we do hills
01:40:15 you know i put like a weight vest on
01:40:18 i have a thing called an atlas trainer
01:40:21 it's a backpack that i put
01:40:22 olympic weights on the back of it like
01:40:24 it has a like a you know like you have a
01:40:26 plate a barbell
01:40:27 yeah i get so like uh the dumbbell
01:40:29 plates go over it and then i
01:40:31 screw in this uh collar and i have like
01:40:34 a
01:40:35 an olympic plate on my back and so i do
01:40:37 uh
01:40:38 i'll hike with those on with the dog and
01:40:40 uh do
01:40:41 do you take days off no yeah you have to
01:40:44 recover yeah i don't need is that hard
01:40:47 to do
01:40:48 no no i don't think i'm addicted to
01:40:50 exercise no you seem to have a healthy
01:40:53 but i'm carrying a lifestyle with
01:40:54 everything i can get addicted to
01:40:56 everything okay
01:40:56 you can oh yeah i had a real real
01:40:58 problem with video games in the past
01:41:01 eight hours a day like even more how
01:41:03 interesting and irresistible is it that
01:41:05 people who make those video games don't
01:41:06 even let themselves play that yeah how
01:41:08 about that world of warcraft story
01:41:10 how about the one kid who's a football
01:41:12 player who lost his fuck basically
01:41:13 his life fell apart fell out of school
01:41:16 everything
01:41:16 just it can happen i so you used to be
01:41:19 that way
01:41:20 we fucking set up a local area network
01:41:22 in the back and we have all these
01:41:23 computers back
01:41:24 yeah that we set up and i had to stop
01:41:26 playing them because we would be in here
01:41:28 and i would be playing five six hours a
01:41:29 day after podcasts
01:41:31 right and it was like for months and i'm
01:41:33 like i've stopped
01:41:34 and i had to get out of here i'd be
01:41:35 sweaty my adrenaline would be off
01:41:37 also recently you've dealt with was it
01:41:40 like a year and a half ago
01:41:41 yeah about two maybe two years ago what
01:41:43 about drinking for you what about
01:41:45 drugging no no never
01:41:48 never compulsive yeah yeah drinking the
01:41:51 problem with drinking is it always has
01:41:53 a negative physical effect yes so that
01:41:56 i'm not into things that fuck with my
01:41:58 body
01:41:58 so when i do something negative then it
01:42:00 fucks with my real
01:42:01 addiction which is the exercise
01:42:03 addiction so if i have
01:42:05 if i have an addiction at all for
01:42:07 physical life it's an exercise addiction
01:42:09 but it's not an addiction like i have to
01:42:10 do it if i don't do it i freak out
01:42:12 it's like if i don't do it i don't feel
01:42:13 good yes like i like to be
01:42:16 calm i like to feel good i like to be
01:42:18 friendly i like to feel
01:42:20 like even i don't feel even if i don't
01:42:23 work out if i don't work out for four or
01:42:25 five days
01:42:26 i just feel like real tense and
01:42:29 like short trigger like short fuse
01:42:32 what's something that sets you off when
01:42:34 like
01:42:34 your wife can sense it your kids can
01:42:36 sense it if you haven't worked out
01:42:38 like what's gonna what's something that
01:42:39 i don't let myself get to that oh that's
01:42:41 good yeah i don't let myself get that
01:42:43 but if
01:42:43 how do you stop yourself meditation yeah
01:42:46 i definitely do a lot of meditation
01:42:47 meditation
01:42:48 float tank sauna i do a lot of breathing
01:42:51 exercises in the sauna i do a lot of
01:42:54 that
01:42:54 but i just know me i know me and i don't
01:42:57 like me
01:42:57 when i don't work out i don't like that
01:42:59 guy yeah i don't like me if i don't
01:43:01 meditate
01:43:01 and i don't let myself get away with it
01:43:03 but it's just i also
01:43:05 since the time i've been a young boy
01:43:08 i've been doing
01:43:09 savage things so from like my whole life
01:43:12 i've been in martial arts so
01:43:14 my body's just like what are we hitting
01:43:16 today
01:43:17 come on what are we choking come on we
01:43:19 gotta go like and if i don't do that
01:43:22 my body's like uh any day now we're
01:43:24 gonna we're going to war
01:43:26 like shit is about to happen it's going
01:43:28 down so your body starts getting
01:43:29 it's like a battery like you're storing
01:43:31 up all this energy
01:43:32 and if you don't if you don't release it
01:43:34 it's like it's overflowing it's coming
01:43:36 off the top
01:43:37 and so i i i exercise just to maintain
01:43:41 homeostasis to maintain balance to
01:43:44 maintain
01:43:45 like just just just to be just have
01:43:48 clarity
01:43:48 yeah so that you're just the best
01:43:50 version of yourself you're pushing
01:43:52 yourself
01:43:52 100 percent i am the best friend i'm the
01:43:54 nicest person i can be
01:43:56 when i when i exercise a lot now what if
01:43:58 you go through a time where you don't
01:44:00 get a lot of exercise and you just can't
01:44:01 finish it i was going to just exercise
01:44:04 fit into my schedule what does that mean
01:44:05 you figure you figure out a way you wake
01:44:07 up
01:44:07 that is the schedule like there's no
01:44:09 like do what do i forget to eat
01:44:11 yeah exactly do i forget to sleep i
01:44:14 don't forget to sleep
01:44:15 so why the fuck would i forget to
01:44:16 exercise yeah it's just next i think
01:44:17 i've ever gone more than a week in my
01:44:19 life without exercising
01:44:20 yeah i mean doing something i have to
01:44:23 unless i've been injured
01:44:24 unless i have like a bad injury like a
01:44:25 surgery or something like that what
01:44:27 about stand-up
01:44:28 addiction i think i definitely have a
01:44:32 stand-up addiction
01:44:33 and i think that i really it really uh i
01:44:36 think i feel like if i have any
01:44:37 depression at all
01:44:38 it's this low-level lull from not doing
01:44:42 stand-up for all these months it's a
01:44:44 lull
01:44:44 and then i realized it when i did i did
01:44:46 the improv in houston
01:44:48 yeah and and it was like oh my god we're
01:44:50 back and i
01:44:51 said like fuck it dude i'm i went with
01:44:53 brian moses and tony hinchcliffe and we
01:44:55 were like dude
01:44:56 let's fucking just keep doing this let's
01:44:58 just keep traveling around the country
01:44:59 any place that wants to have us
01:45:00 and then i started thinking i got really
01:45:02 high and i started thinking what if i
01:45:04 gave it to somebody what if i got it i'd
01:45:05 give it to somebody and then i'm like i
01:45:07 can't do that
01:45:07 that was the thing that i feared what i
01:45:10 feared the most is giving it to somebody
01:45:12 yeah that's giving it to like some a
01:45:13 guest that gets really sick
01:45:15 i know that's that's the fear yeah
01:45:17 that's why outdoor shows
01:45:18 some people that are getting it it fucks
01:45:20 them up for months
01:45:22 i know people don't ever reca people
01:45:24 still haven't recovered that got it back
01:45:25 in march right they have still a fatigue
01:45:27 they can't get out of their issues yeah
01:45:29 their hair's falling out
01:45:30 they're i mean these side effects they
01:45:33 they could last
01:45:34 who knows forever it's really scary it's
01:45:36 a weird
01:45:37 fucking disease it's a weird disease it
01:45:39 doesn't really make sense because it's
01:45:41 not like any other disease like
01:45:42 everybody who gets the flu you there's
01:45:45 like it's real similar
01:45:46 it's not like one person gets the flu
01:45:48 and it's nothing or another person gets
01:45:50 the food they can't smell anything for
01:45:52 six months like people are they're
01:45:54 losing their sense of smell
01:45:55 i know they lose their sense of taste
01:45:57 like for months like michael yo got it
01:46:00 real bad where he was hospitalized and
01:46:02 he is he's still suffering for fatigue
01:46:05 from fatigue
01:46:06 like two months later he would get tired
01:46:08 walking up a flight of stairs
01:46:09 so you get like lung scarring and all
01:46:11 kinds of weird shit happens
01:46:13 yeah okay you're not scared of getting
01:46:15 it no
01:46:17 but what about all that shit you're just
01:46:18 scared of giving that to someone yeah
01:46:20 you just feel like your body's gonna
01:46:21 be okay yeah yeah yeah i'll be okay
01:46:24 do you get the flu yeah but barely yeah
01:46:28 if i do so much though i do like iv
01:46:31 vitamin drips all the time and i'm on
01:46:33 all these vitamins and
01:46:34 constantly working out i mean i can get
01:46:36 sick but i don't get sick much
01:46:38 and when i get sick it's like it goes by
01:46:40 pretty quick yeah me too
01:46:42 but it's uh but it's i'm i'm keeping my
01:46:45 body healthy i eat
01:46:47 elk meat and all this healthy food and
01:46:49 it's like
01:46:50 your body if your body's in tune
01:46:54 and your body's healthy and your immune
01:46:55 system is strong that's the whole point
01:46:58 of having a strong immune system it's
01:47:00 supposed to be able to fight things off
01:47:01 and
01:47:02 i haven't gotten like a real cold in
01:47:05 years
01:47:06 because i take care of myself and i do a
01:47:09 good job but if i was working on a
01:47:10 television show and i was
01:47:12 not getting good sleep or i was
01:47:14 traveling a lot
01:47:15 and i was not getting good sleep and
01:47:17 that's when it could hit you and that's
01:47:18 what it hit michael yo

01:48:36 get sucked into instagram i mean what's
01:48:38 your app that you just get
01:48:40 no youtube i like watching videos yeah
01:48:43 it's distracting
01:48:44 yeah i just get bored now what you do
01:48:46 when you work out
01:48:48 what youtube yeah like when you're like
01:48:49 on a treadmill or something what are you
01:48:50 doing are you just like
01:48:51 in the moment trying maybe i'll watch
01:48:54 music fights
01:48:55 okay if i'm watching something i like i
01:48:57 watch fights or i listen to a book
01:48:59 and i work out but uh most of oh yeah i
01:49:02 was wondering like
01:49:03 picturing you reading a book like do you
01:49:04 just like sit in a chair
01:49:06 and like flip through a book like how
01:49:07 does joe rogan read a book
01:49:09 most of the reading i do is audio books
01:49:11 okay so the most it was
01:49:12 me not reading yeah reading is like
01:49:15 scientific articles i'll read like
01:49:17 things that you can't get in audiobooks
01:49:19 yeah but i do most of
01:49:22 the most of the information that i get
01:49:24 from books is either driving
01:49:26 or in a sauna i like listening inside
01:49:28 put air pods on
01:49:30 you can use air pods in the sauna even
01:49:31 at 180 degrees
01:49:33 jesus they don't conk out so how long
01:49:35 are you in there 30 minutes
01:49:36 okay i used to but that's another thing
01:49:38 it's like i keep escalating that
01:49:39 you said 20 minutes and now i moved it
01:49:42 like oh don't be a pussy make it 25
01:49:43 minutes
01:49:44 and then it's like 30 and i'm not
01:49:46 satisfied with 30. so now it has to be
01:49:47 31. yes so you understand my porn thing
01:49:49 oh yeah yeah oh yeah i just don't have
01:49:51 the porn thing that way
01:49:53 my porn is like if i watch porn it's
01:49:55 normal it's people that are horny they
01:49:56 fuck
01:49:56 that's that's the or yeah or it's like
01:49:59 oh we probably shouldn't be doing this
01:50:00 you know like that kind of porn
01:50:02 right you know like stuff like that but
01:50:04 nothing nothing crazy okay
01:50:06 yeah but i get it like i get all of it
01:50:10 like
01:50:10 the video game thing i get more than
01:50:12 anything because i've had like real
01:50:13 well that's nice to hear that even
01:50:15 recently you've struggled with that
01:50:16 because you seem
01:50:17 to be someone who doesn't have to deal
01:50:20 with it but it's all
01:50:21 because i'm calculated about it that's
01:50:23 all it is it's like
01:50:24 you see it starting to affect your
01:50:27 well-being
01:50:28 i went cold turkey you go you quit it
01:50:30 you can't quit
01:50:32 and then we played again when we had the
01:50:33 guys who make doom we had them come in
01:50:35 here and we played for a day
01:50:36 and even that day i was like i got out
01:50:38 of here all shaky i was like i can't do
01:50:39 that again
01:50:40 i don't do that again and then you do
01:50:42 you do you feel like you're white
01:50:43 knuckling it
01:50:44 oh you're like god damn it i'm missing
01:50:46 out but you have just amazing discipline
01:50:48 well the video games are so addictive
01:50:50 because they're so immersive and the one
01:50:52 we're playing is quake champions
01:50:54 so you put these headphones on like if
01:50:55 jamie was playing with me if he was over
01:50:57 here i could hear him over here i hear
01:50:58 him walking
01:50:59 and the vid the graphics are so
01:51:01 incredible and it's a three-dimensional
01:51:02 game right so you're running down these
01:51:04 hallways and
01:51:05 people are shooting rockets at you and
01:51:06 you're jumping up off these things and
01:51:08 you're running through the water and
01:51:09 people are chasing you it's so fun
01:51:12 it's exciting that's as good as going on
01:51:14 a hike no
01:51:16 why because first of all because you're
01:51:19 you could do it all
01:51:20 day no d no vitamin d no vitamin c
01:51:23 you're doing it all day right you can
01:51:25 plant hours and hours and hours and you
01:51:26 get exhausted afterwards
01:51:28 and and it becomes a compulsion like you
01:51:30 leave here you're driving you think
01:51:32 about oh he should have shot me then
01:51:33 yeah i should have got him
01:51:35 and that time i fucked up i shouldn't
01:51:36 have gone into the lava i should have
01:51:37 went that way
01:51:38 you have all these crazy thoughts in
01:51:40 your head about the game and it's like
01:51:42 i they're really fun that's the problems
01:51:45 they're really good
01:51:47 but for me at least they waste too much
01:51:50 time
01:51:50 and i get too sucked in and then it
01:51:52 becomes unhealthy right
01:51:54 because it becomes like you can only
01:51:56 exercise so much
01:51:57 you know especially like the way i'm
01:51:59 doing it yeah tell us how much that is
01:52:01 because you definitely
01:52:02 hit cooking half a day yeah that's it
01:52:05 that's it no more than that these people
01:52:07 that are at the gym for four hours at a
01:52:08 time i'm sorry that's an addiction
01:52:10 maybe at that point unless you're
01:52:12 training for something
01:52:13 how are you doing you can't hit the bag
01:52:15 for four hours
01:52:16 right i guess people are kind of like
01:52:18 rosie and about i'm doing like
01:52:20 i do rounds like so i'll set the timer
01:52:22 for three minutes it's like a timer it's
01:52:24 like ding ding ding ding
01:52:25 it goes off and it lets you know every
01:52:27 30 seconds so i have this ringside timer
01:52:29 and it says an interval timer so
01:52:31 every 30 seconds it gives you a ping it
01:52:34 gives you a
01:52:34 big curves gym right so sort of so in 30
01:52:38 seconds
01:52:38 you know you're sprinting for 30 seconds
01:52:41 and then you're
01:52:42 you're you're doing it at a slower pace
01:52:44 for the next 30 seconds and then you're
01:52:45 sprinting again
01:52:46 and there's a red light there's a red
01:52:48 light and then there's a yellow light
01:52:50 and it's a red light is when it's time
01:52:52 to stop the yellow light is when you're
01:52:54 common and in blue light is go
01:52:56 so it has these three lights right go
01:52:58 means sprint
01:53:00 yellow means coast red means stop and so
01:53:02 it's like this
01:53:03 very regimented you know exactly when
01:53:05 you're done so when i'm doing
01:53:06 like especially like rounds on the back
01:53:08 you can only do it so much
01:53:10 because your body breaks down because
01:53:12 during those the blue time
01:53:14 it's just chaos it's 30 seconds of just
01:53:18 assault
01:53:18 like you can't keep that up yeah it's
01:53:21 just too crazy it's just
01:53:23 and then when it's over and then the the
01:53:26 next 30 seconds it's calmer it's like
01:53:28 you're just sort of like getting your
01:53:29 heart rate down and just going through
01:53:30 the techniques and moving
01:53:32 and then the blue light comes on again
01:53:34 thing and it's like
01:53:36 so you can't you can only do it for so
01:53:38 long right
01:53:39 yeah but when it's over i'm like ah
01:53:41 chirp chirp chirp
01:53:42 birds and love and everybody's my friend
01:53:45 yeah i feel good that way after a
01:53:47 after a hard workout too i mean you need
01:53:49 it you get the endorphin rush but you
01:53:51 also
01:53:52 you you beat the demons down that's the
01:53:55 thing is all the aggression
01:53:57 just goes out of me like all the the
01:53:59 pent up stress
01:54:00 and i just think that my body's
01:54:01 conditioned to do this it's been doing
01:54:03 it for so long that if i don't do it
01:54:05 it just like goes when is it coming
01:54:07 when's it coming yeah when's the war
01:54:09 when's the chaos when's it coming you
01:54:12 need
01:54:13 to do you cry ever
01:54:16 i cry for happy things yeah most of the
01:54:18 time i cry when i'm happy for people
01:54:21 but i cry if i think about you know like
01:54:23 people that i miss
01:54:24 and you know stuff like that that's good
01:54:26 i definitely cry
01:54:28 yeah well i i cry a lot for like things
01:54:31 that make me happy
01:54:32 that's uh that's really yeah that's cute
01:54:35 yeah i craft four people
01:54:36 i cry when i'm happy for people but uh
01:54:39 yeah i cry
01:54:40 i feel that i know i'm not scared of
01:54:42 emotions yeah
01:54:43 you know nice yeah i'm
01:54:47 scared of weakness i don't like weakness
01:54:50 but i don't think crying is weakness i
01:54:51 think it's weak to not want to cry
01:54:53 i think it's not it's weak to not want
01:54:56 to embrace
01:54:57 the full spectrum of life you know life
01:55:00 is
01:55:01 filled with beautiful things and amazing
01:55:03 things and it's also filled with
01:55:04 horrible things
01:55:05 like they're all there and to deny that
01:55:08 i think is to deny
01:55:09 reality it is and that is to be
01:55:11 delusional i'm afraid of being
01:55:13 delusional more than i'm afraid of
01:55:15 crying
01:55:15 i think it's really important that you
01:55:17 just said that you cry and you think
01:55:19 it's important
01:55:19 because i think so many people that
01:55:20 listen to you do not
01:55:22 so many men don't cry joe you know that
01:55:25 they do i think they just don't want
01:55:27 people to know well maybe they don't but
01:55:29 i just don't think they'll allow
01:55:30 themselves to and i'm i put myself in
01:55:32 that category like it's
01:55:33 really hard for me to cry like i have to
01:55:36 i have to
01:55:37 be talking to someone about my i have to
01:55:38 have it kind of mirrored back to me
01:55:40 my emotions so that i can have license
01:55:42 to cry but
01:55:43 it's not something that that comes
01:55:45 naturally to people but i think it's
01:55:47 important to do
01:55:48 which i cried on the podcasters real
01:55:50 recently really
01:55:51 yeah there was a guy on uh josh dubin
01:55:54 from the
01:55:55 he's a lawyer and they were talking
01:55:56 about the innocence project he works
01:55:58 with the innocence project and they
01:56:00 got this poor man who is an immigrant
01:56:03 i believe he's from guatemala who was
01:56:06 unjustly accused of murder and they they
01:56:08 got him out and you know they were just
01:56:09 going through the whole story
01:56:11 about how the prosecutors were trying to
01:56:12 keep him in jail even though he knew he
01:56:14 was innocent and they
01:56:15 they finally got him released and
01:56:16 they're talking about this thing and i
01:56:17 just start crying
01:56:18 yeah this poor guy he's thinking about
01:56:20 this guy who like makes his way to
01:56:22 america to try to do better for himself
01:56:24 and
01:56:25 it winds up getting caught up in this
01:56:27 this fake murder
01:56:29 this god accusation and yeah yeah i
01:56:32 cried about that
01:56:33 yeah i just i think men need to cry more
01:56:36 and and is that another one of your
01:56:39 folders
01:56:40 yeah men crying and then i'm seriously
01:56:42 turned on by men crying i love it
01:56:45 can i really put that out there i uh the
01:56:47 one time my ex-boyfriend cried in front
01:56:49 of me
01:56:49 you got hot i was blowing him while he
01:56:52 was like still
01:56:54 like sniffling like still his tears were
01:56:56 like hitting me on the head
01:56:58 i'm not joking you it was i felt so
01:57:00 inappropriate doing it but i was like
01:57:02 this is so hot that you are opening up
01:57:04 and you are emoting
01:57:06 and that i don't have to deal with these
01:57:07 feelings on a in another way which is
01:57:09 you being mad at me are you like
01:57:10 bottling up your anger i mean these
01:57:12 feelings have to come out somewhere it
01:57:13 just was so
01:57:14 erotic to me to see a guy like so
01:57:17 so sensitive i think it's very weak of
01:57:20 people to be afraid
01:57:22 of feelings yes there's nothing wrong
01:57:24 with feelings but there's feelings can't
01:57:25 kill you
01:57:26 there's something wrong with being a
01:57:27 bitch though like there's a difference
01:57:29 this is what's important there's
01:57:30 something wrong with being weak there's
01:57:32 something wrong with like shirking your
01:57:34 responsibility
01:57:35 or not doing the things that you know
01:57:38 you're supposed to do
01:57:39 because you want to cry and wallow away
01:57:42 all your day
01:57:43 and feel sorry for yourself like i i do
01:57:46 not support people feeling sorry for
01:57:47 themselves
01:57:48 because that's a there's a perspective
01:57:50 there's a particularly with men
01:57:52 there's a perspective you can change
01:57:54 your perspective you can you can just
01:57:56 take action and do things there's
01:57:58 nothing wrong with feeling sad
01:58:00 there's nothing wrong with feeling
01:58:01 emotional but there is something wrong
01:58:03 with feeling sorry for yourself
01:58:04 and there's a lot of men who feel sorry
01:58:06 for yourself for no fucking reason
01:58:08 really but i think feeling sorry for
01:58:10 yourself is
01:58:11 important why because
01:58:14 we that's that allows you to feel those
01:58:17 feelings to say you know what i had i
01:58:20 had a shitty childhood i had a shitty
01:58:22 mom
01:58:22 and i i got a i got a fucked up deal
01:58:25 i was i i that guy from guatemala that
01:58:28 came here like
01:58:29 he should feel sorry for himself his
01:58:31 life got
01:58:32 i don't know if he should feel sorry for
01:58:34 himself i definitely think he should
01:58:36 feel
01:58:36 the pain of what happened to him i mean
01:58:38 there's no way he can't
01:58:40 and i definitely think that you know he
01:58:42 should feel happy
01:58:43 that he's been released and that these
01:58:45 wonderful people work really hard to get
01:58:47 him out and then i
01:58:48 also think he should feel some anger
01:58:49 that these motherfuckers wanted to keep
01:58:51 him in jail when they knew he was
01:58:52 innocent
01:58:53 i mean i think there's nothing wrong
01:58:54 with all those things but to be
01:58:56 to just be paralyzed by that and not do
01:58:58 anything and then use it as an excuse to
01:59:00 never live your life fuck that
01:59:03 that's the difference and that is a
01:59:04 choice and that is also something that
01:59:06 you get
01:59:06 you learn as a man there's people that
01:59:09 can
01:59:10 there's people that you can count on and
01:59:12 there's people that are going to fall
01:59:13 apart
01:59:14 and there's a difference there's there's
01:59:16 moments in your life
01:59:17 where you can be dwarfed by that moment
01:59:20 or
01:59:20 you can rise to the occasion okay and
01:59:22 who you are
01:59:24 forever is dependent upon how you react
01:59:27 those moments
01:59:28 and you could just decide i care
01:59:30 everything is too hard and you just
01:59:32 be a bitch or you can go yeah this is
01:59:34 hard but i'm gonna do it anyway
01:59:36 i'm gonna get through this and then you
01:59:38 learn oh i could do it
01:59:40 oh i could move forward and the people
01:59:42 that learn that
01:59:43 they need to tell other people that they
01:59:46 learn that and then
01:59:47 other people can learn it as well it's
01:59:49 it's a reaction
01:59:51 to pain a reaction to bad feelings
01:59:54 but to take action to be a person
01:59:58 who actually recognizes that these
02:00:01 feelings are normal
02:00:02 but you still have to keep going you
02:00:04 still have to move on with your life
02:00:05 that's the difference
02:00:07 because that makes sense there's too
02:00:08 many people that just use
02:00:10 whatever happens in their life as an
02:00:12 excuse
02:00:13 for why they're a failure or uses an
02:00:15 excuse
02:00:16 for why you know other people do well
02:00:18 well i can't because
02:00:20 this happened when i was young just
02:00:22 right just fucking get up and go
02:00:24 just go i think you can do that after
02:00:27 you acknowledge
02:00:28 like you can let yourself feel sorry for
02:00:30 yourself a little bit don't
02:00:31 sit in that too long but but if you
02:00:33 always because i
02:00:34 i think i'm just speaking more to myself
02:00:36 because i've had to actually
02:00:38 seek out therapists who teach me how to
02:00:40 feel sorry for myself because so much of
02:00:42 me is like what are you complaining
02:00:44 about look at your life shut
02:00:45 come on you don't have anything to cry
02:00:47 about don't feel sorry for yourself
02:00:48 don't do that
02:00:49 and then i never get to feel sad
02:00:53 they go my god that sounds really hard
02:00:55 and i go well it's
02:00:56 people have it worse it's fine no let's
02:00:59 go back
02:01:00 you were scared then you didn't get the
02:01:02 support you needed
02:01:03 that's really that's not fair that sucks
02:01:05 that that happened to you will you feel
02:01:07 that
02:01:07 will you feel that you needed a more
02:01:10 support back then when you didn't get it
02:01:12 and you were scared and you didn't know
02:01:13 any different because you were a little
02:01:14 girl like
02:01:15 they take me back there and they go feel
02:01:17 sorry for her feel sad for that girl
02:01:19 and i have to go back and kind of let
02:01:21 myself go feel sorry for myself and is
02:01:23 there a relief in doing that
02:01:25 yeah i think it it allows me to
02:01:28 stop pushing all my feelings down and
02:01:30 being like i gotta be brave i can't
02:01:32 complain cause what are you crying about
02:01:34 you
02:01:34 you have a roof over yet you have
02:01:36 parents who love you but once they do
02:01:38 that is there a build up afterwards like
02:01:40 a build backup
02:01:41 or they're like okay now that you've
02:01:42 acknowledged the fact that you're
02:01:44 validated
02:01:45 or you you have valid feelings and that
02:01:47 there's a reason why you felt fucked
02:01:49 over
02:01:50 is a reason why you felt abandoned now
02:01:52 that you've like
02:01:53 let's look on positive aspects of nikki
02:01:55 glazer let's look at
02:01:56 life let's look at let's have some
02:01:58 perspective do they do that
02:02:00 um we haven't gotten there yet because
02:02:01 we haven't covered all the trump that's
02:02:03 the worry the
02:02:04 my worry is that there's merchants that
02:02:07 there's they there's there's something
02:02:10 very
02:02:10 valuable in selling pity
02:02:13 there's something very valuable in in
02:02:16 dwelling on these moments of your life
02:02:18 that have been bad and i think there's
02:02:20 something
02:02:21 in what you're saying that is valid
02:02:23 before you were
02:02:24 dealing with this where you're saying
02:02:26 look at your life like you've got it
02:02:27 better than a lot of people
02:02:29 what are you complaining about like not
02:02:31 that you should look at it that way
02:02:33 but that there are positive and negative
02:02:36 ways to look at things
02:02:37 the thing about having bad child having
02:02:40 a bad childhood
02:02:41 and having bad childhood experiences
02:02:44 is that it makes you a more interesting
02:02:47 and resilient person
02:02:49 and that is undeniable and that i think
02:02:52 is something that
02:02:54 it's very difficult for people to come
02:02:55 to grips with or they look at their
02:02:57 childhood and they look at bad aspects
02:02:58 of their life
02:02:59 they want to dwell on them like okay get
02:03:02 that out of your system
02:03:03 then i want you to look at it this way
02:03:05 that has given you
02:03:06 a depth that most people don't possess
02:03:10 yeah and that's why you're interesting i
02:03:12 know everyone that i know who's
02:03:14 interesting has had some fucked up
02:03:16 childhood and as a parent
02:03:17 it's weird because i want to protect my
02:03:19 children from adversity
02:03:20 but yet all of my favorite people have
02:03:23 come from advertising
02:03:24 fucked up i know that's gotta feel com
02:03:28 cause you wanna make the best
02:03:29 you want your kids to be funny you want
02:03:31 them yeah that's usually the case it's
02:03:33 like whenever i see someone who's just
02:03:35 like
02:03:36 sometimes you meet someone who's like
02:03:37 stunning but they're all so funny and
02:03:39 you're like
02:03:40 what how and then you're like oh you
02:03:42 were molested okay
02:03:43 now that makes sense exactly you had you
02:03:45 had to go through something
02:03:46 fucking yes awful yeah to develop a
02:03:49 personality
02:03:50 so you're right i mean i i i'm so
02:03:52 grateful for
02:03:53 uh those times when i was little and
02:03:56 scared and confused and felt abandoned
02:03:58 and all of these things and i had great
02:03:59 parents who did
02:04:01 they couldn't have done better it but i
02:04:03 was just a sensitive child who needed a
02:04:05 little bit more
02:04:06 but um but i i don't think it's
02:04:09 it's serving me anymore to just suck it
02:04:12 up
02:04:13 and say what are you so sorry about what
02:04:15 are you so sad about you shouldn't be so
02:04:17 sad
02:04:17 because i really struggle with that
02:04:18 that's why i keep asking like are you
02:04:20 depressed joe
02:04:21 do you know anyone i i need to find
02:04:22 people who are depressed that my life is
02:04:24 so
02:04:24 good though yeah the problem is if like
02:04:26 if i was depressed it would be like
02:04:27 really
02:04:28 disheartening for everybody but that's
02:04:30 that has a life that's not as fortunate
02:04:32 right but i'm i think my depression is
02:04:35 all is chemical
02:04:36 i mean i think it's just like my brain
02:04:38 was i was born that way there's nothing
02:04:39 my parents could have done
02:04:41 differently to make me not suffer with
02:04:43 depression and that
02:04:45 that i just have to i have to feel i
02:04:47 have to i have to feel sad like oh that
02:04:48 sucks that i have a brain that tells me
02:04:50 to kill myself once a quarter
02:04:53 and that i have to have those thoughts
02:04:55 and i think those thoughts are right and
02:04:56 i know that i'm never gonna act on those
02:04:58 thoughts but
02:04:59 that sucks that i even have to have them
02:05:01 is there a correlation though
02:05:03 between how well your life is going like
02:05:06 when your life is going great and how
02:05:07 good you feel
02:05:08 no no so that's man that's the best my
02:05:11 life has gone is some of the worst times
02:05:13 that's where there's a real solid
02:05:16 argument for the chemical imbalance
02:05:18 right
02:05:18 because there's some people that i know
02:05:20 that have had depression
02:05:21 but they've only had it when their life
02:05:23 was in the shitter like when a girl left
02:05:24 them or when they lost a job or things
02:05:27 started going then they got depression
02:05:29 and i'm always like hmm
02:05:31 what is the difference between
02:05:32 depression and not doing well so you
02:05:34 feel bad
02:05:35 yes there's a difference yeah the
02:05:37 chemical depression that you're
02:05:38 discussing that's the real shit
02:05:40 that's like the real mental like there's
02:05:43 a there's like a
02:05:44 clogged pipe or something yeah it's not
02:05:47 going through
02:05:48 and it doesn't and i and you look at
02:05:50 your life and you look at everything
02:05:51 that's going on and
02:05:52 you just it doesn't make sense why you
02:05:54 feel so sad or why you feel like such a
02:05:56 fraud or why you feel like
02:05:58 you should kill yourself i mean like
02:06:00 right
02:06:01 what what is that right i don't know and
02:06:03 and and then the thoughts are so
02:06:06 they're not even like i sit down and go
02:06:09 i want to feel sad and like think of
02:06:10 ways to kill myself it's like i'll just
02:06:12 be sitting there and i'll be like kill
02:06:13 yours like
02:06:14 like whisper like i'm not i don't hear
02:06:16 voices but they're just they're not
02:06:17 thoughts i want to have
02:06:19 the thought it really it yeah i mean i
02:06:22 really
02:06:23 i compare it to feeling getting a cold
02:06:25 like it just i feel it coming on i'm
02:06:27 like oh shit there's a spot and i don't
02:06:28 know what
02:06:28 you get these right when you close your
02:06:30 laptop after kink.com
02:06:34 usually that's what i'm feeling pretty
02:06:35 good that's what i'm feeling the best
02:06:38 is after i've done that i don't have
02:06:39 that depression that people have of of
02:06:41 like
02:06:41 regret i mean i'm disgusted about
02:06:43 talking about all these things that i'm
02:06:44 into
02:06:45 when and and and honestly i only
02:06:47 masturbate once every two weeks so this
02:06:49 isn't like an addiction for me it's just
02:06:51 but when it comes on it's more like a
02:06:53 freight train yeah when i open my laptop
02:06:56 it's time to go going into war
02:06:59 anal graduate three like and just
02:07:02 women who are going through some kind of
02:07:05 master's course
02:07:06 tom segura sent me a video the other day
02:07:08 i'll show it to if you like
02:07:10 but uh i don't remember what i sent him
02:07:12 but he sent me a video of this young
02:07:13 lady
02:07:13 they were just saying hey lane how are
02:07:15 you back and she's just
02:07:17 punching herself in the vagina what and

02:07:23 what are you please
02:07:24 going in and i'm like what in the hell
02:07:28 i've learned so much about the
02:07:30 plasticity of
02:07:31 vaginas and assholes it's crazy from
02:07:34 king.com
02:07:35 it's great it doesn't seem like it
02:07:36 should be real
02:07:38 a lot can go on yeah a lot can fit up
02:07:41 there
02:07:42 that you just can't even believe
02:07:45 there's just something so like oh my god
02:07:47 whoa
02:07:49 yeah that's what i'm saying it looks
02:07:50 like she's playing that price is right
02:07:51 game where you punch
02:07:52 through she just keeps going in there oh
02:07:55 my god when she's so angry
02:07:56 her face oh my god
02:08:00 that's what i'm saying yeah no no no
02:08:03 no no keeps doing it for a long time too
02:08:06 by the way it's a long video yeah
02:08:08 tom if you ever need like something
02:08:10 fucked up to look at
02:08:11 holler at tom okay thompson yeah tom and
02:08:14 christine he's got his fucking weird
02:08:15 shit he's got his finger on the pulse
02:08:17 oh yeah did you see the one of like the
02:08:18 balls being shit out of the ass yeah
02:08:21 that was kind of weirdly beautiful
02:08:24 well very unusual yeah first of all to
02:08:27 have balls that will make it all the way
02:08:28 to your ass is weird
02:08:30 and then not just make it all the way to
02:08:32 your ass but go inside
02:08:33 like all the tucked inside like he's
02:08:35 laying eggs
02:08:36 the stuff he puts on twitter and filmed
02:08:38 it yeah
02:08:40 i had to set up a camera yeah i mean
02:08:42 that guy's been practicing that girl
02:08:44 that was just violently fisting herself
02:08:47 had to like
02:08:47 prop up her camera across the room and
02:08:49 then go scoot or somebody else is
02:08:51 filming it
02:08:52 oh yeah that's true yeah but the guy
02:08:53 with the balls up his ass
02:08:55 apparently he lets guys fuck him in the
02:08:58 ass with his balls in his ass
02:09:00 and his favorite thing is fucking guys
02:09:02 while he has his own balls in his ass
02:09:05 yeah okay okay like hey listen you can't
02:09:09 judge
02:09:10 i i certainly can't it makes me feel
02:09:12 less alone that there are people out
02:09:13 there that are
02:09:14 weirder stuff than i am there's people
02:09:16 in the weird shit that's
02:09:17 the weirdest thing about human sexuality
02:09:19 is the spectrum of it like how much
02:09:21 how weird like one thing that you would
02:09:24 say to another person would turn them on
02:09:25 another person would never call you
02:09:26 again like yeah fucking freak
02:09:28 yep they'd run away from you i know and
02:09:30 that's why you know so
02:09:32 much of uh stuff on king.com i'm just
02:09:33 like get off of her feet i don't need
02:09:35 you to be
02:09:36 doing that why is she that hurts her
02:09:38 nipples
02:09:39 take those off her nipples like that all
02:09:41 the extra stuff i just one very
02:09:43 i wish i could just i need to just
02:09:44 produce my own porn i think maybe that's
02:09:46 your future
02:09:47 possibly i mean i don't really want to
02:09:49 be in it but i would like to get behind
02:09:51 the camera and make the videos that i'm
02:09:53 craving isn't the thing about porn
02:09:54 though is that like
02:09:56 the girls never really make the money
02:09:58 it's always the producer
02:10:00 and the like the the reason why people
02:10:01 are tuning in
02:10:03 is for the girl yeah but the girl's
02:10:05 never the one who's getting rich
02:10:07 it's always the people but i don't know
02:10:09 if anybody's getting rich anymore
02:10:11 i mean maybe i guess they must be they
02:10:13 must be making some money
02:10:14 fans yeah yeah but that goes to the
02:10:17 girls right
02:10:18 mostly yeah but when i was uh when i
02:10:21 first
02:10:22 bought uh not the house i'm living in
02:10:24 now but another house in the past
02:10:25 i had a neighbor who was bawling out of
02:10:28 control he always had these like
02:10:29 like really nice mercedes benz parked in
02:10:31 his driveway and porsches and shit he
02:10:33 always
02:10:34 was wearing like big fat watches and
02:10:35 shit he was a porn producer
02:10:38 and uh he was uh laughing around about
02:10:40 you know how much money made from porn
02:10:42 but then the internet came along and it
02:10:45 was
02:10:45 so quick it was so quick where the
02:10:49 internet killed his business because
02:10:50 this is you know we're talking about i
02:10:53 guess it was like the 90s the early
02:10:55 2000s
02:10:56 he was making all this money and it was
02:10:58 dvd sales right
02:10:59 and then all of a sudden the internet
02:11:01 came along and online porn and bandwidth
02:11:03 just kicked up to the point where you
02:11:04 could actually stream it and
02:11:06 they foreclosed in his house and i'll
02:11:08 never forget that i'll never forget like
02:11:11 finding out that that guy was losing his
02:11:13 house and i was like wow because that
02:11:15 guy was always like
02:11:16 so flashy like everything was like gold
02:11:19 chains and he had a fucking silver tooth
02:11:21 and he was doing coke all the time and
02:11:23 they always
02:11:23 had girls over his place he was just
02:11:25 making so much money
02:11:27 yeah it was from selling porn but it was
02:11:29 not the girls weren't making that money
02:11:31 no
02:11:31 there's like i mean there's been a few
02:11:33 girls i'm sure that have made a lot of
02:11:35 money in porn but it's real rare
02:11:37 it is rare there's like you know like
02:11:40 yeah it's not it's not the girls that
02:11:42 i'm seeing on kink.com in fact there's a
02:11:44 great documentary on netflix called hot
02:11:46 girls wanted that talks about
02:11:48 oh i heard about that dude it's so it's
02:11:51 so upsetting
02:11:52 these girls they find these girls they
02:11:53 post ads on craigslist and they find
02:11:55 girls that are fresh out of high school
02:11:57 that just want to get out of their small
02:11:58 town
02:11:59 and they're promised to make a thousand
02:12:01 bucks a day
02:12:02 you know if you do like six shoots maybe
02:12:05 and they burn out within like four
02:12:08 months
02:12:09 and they make they shoot all these
02:12:11 videos that are up forever
02:12:13 forever and then they and they get
02:12:16 really sick
02:12:17 they're they get like they get over
02:12:20 too much use down there and they have to
02:12:22 go to the doctor and they have
02:12:23 different abrasions and certain things
02:12:25 and that's how they get
02:12:26 and they then they're doing really
02:12:28 fetishy type stuff where
02:12:30 there's one girl that is in it that has
02:12:32 to do like a brutal session which
02:12:34 king.com has a lot of brutal videos
02:12:35 which i hate that word in porn because
02:12:37 that's usually like
02:12:38 do you just see girls that you're like
02:12:39 oh she she could not have left that
02:12:42 shoot feeling
02:12:43 empowered about herself no matter what i
02:12:45 mean that is
02:12:46 it's just so sad what they say and do
02:12:48 these girls
02:12:49 and in that in that movie there was one
02:12:51 girl that was like
02:12:52 yeah i went to a brutal session today
02:12:54 and
02:12:55 i had to and she you could just see like
02:12:57 the life
02:12:59 lost in her eyes and these girls just
02:13:00 last they i mean a year is a really long
02:13:02 time for them to last and they think
02:13:04 it's going to be like this glamorous
02:13:05 life i mean they're so young
02:13:07 but it that's well when you're 18 years
02:13:09 old you're
02:13:10 basically a kid yeah you're not really i
02:13:13 mean you're an adult
02:13:14 only on paper and in size you know but
02:13:17 you're a kid
02:13:18 like your mind's not formed yet and your
02:13:21 ideas of what
02:13:22 what's okay and what's not okay they
02:13:24 don't they're not they pay for your
02:13:25 plane ticket to go to miami
02:13:27 and live in this house with a bunch of
02:13:29 other porn stars and it's like this
02:13:30 shitty fucking
02:13:32 apartment with the producer who lives
02:13:33 with you and you're taking care of his
02:13:35 dog
02:13:35 i mean it's it's you got that
02:13:37 documentary is really
02:13:39 incredible and it makes you second guess
02:13:41 where where
02:13:42 where your porn comes from that's why i
02:13:43 gotta pay for mine but it's also the
02:13:45 the way people look at you forever like
02:13:48 if you have a sexual
02:13:49 relationship with a person and someone
02:13:52 does crazy shit to you
02:13:54 that's just what you wanted and you both
02:13:56 did it and that's okay
02:13:58 like you know people maybe people will
02:14:00 laugh but they don't have to see it all
02:14:01 the time right
02:14:02 the thing about porn with a woman is if
02:14:05 a woman does like some crazy gang bangs
02:14:07 or something like that that's always
02:14:08 going to be there
02:14:09 and some guy is you know like hey that
02:14:11 girl that you're gonna marry
02:14:12 check out this link and someone sends
02:14:15 you this link and you go oh my god and
02:14:17 you see
02:14:18 you see her as if she's right there
02:14:20 right now doing this
02:14:22 i know you don't see her as a per
02:14:24 there's a person
02:14:25 who made a mistake when she was 18 and
02:14:27 did this thing but now she's 30
02:14:29 and you love her no you you still she's
02:14:32 broken and down you can get over that
02:14:35 hopefully but a lot of people aren't
02:14:37 sure a lot of people can't
02:14:38 yeah to do that a lot of people they
02:14:40 won't be able to
02:14:42 rationalize or objectively look at this
02:14:46 and go listen she made some mistakes
02:14:48 some people you know some people went to
02:14:50 jail for shoplifting
02:14:51 and then you know they realized you
02:14:53 shouldn't steal and then
02:14:54 you know they get out and then they live
02:14:56 a normal life no one goes oh yeah but
02:14:58 look you're a shoplifter forever
02:15:00 right right although you know i i relate
02:15:04 to some of these
02:15:05 porn actresses just in the sense that
02:15:06 i've said things and
02:15:08 done things on stage or like that i'm
02:15:11 like oh no
02:15:12 that's always going to work i mean like
02:15:13 even today i mean someone's going to
02:15:16 my husband someday might watch this and
02:15:19 we'll be like
02:15:19 look what you were into and what you
02:15:21 admitted yeah but you
02:15:23 are a grown woman you're not a child
02:15:27 right and a man but a man who's into
02:15:30 that
02:15:31 like who's into you would go she's just
02:15:33 being honest i'm just being honest
02:15:35 yeah i think that's what i just try to
02:15:37 be and i like that's empowered
02:15:39 i mean it really it's kind of fucked up
02:15:40 to be empowered that way
02:15:42 because you know what i mean because
02:15:43 like people are like wait a minute
02:15:44 you're empowered by watching girls get
02:15:46 gang raped and gagged and fucking pissed
02:15:48 on and stuff itself
02:15:50 i made that part yeah yeah
02:15:54 yeah no no no but uh but i'll get there
02:15:58 i'll get that but you can you're a grown
02:16:00 woman you can find a man
02:16:01 who recognizes and respects you for what
02:16:04 yeah weird shit you're into as a grown
02:16:05 woman
02:16:06 but when you're 18 years old you're not
02:16:08 even i know you're not a grown-up
02:16:10 just not you know you're a person who's
02:16:12 like legally responsible for yourself
02:16:14 because you're an adult
02:16:16 it's fucking weird it's a weird thing
02:16:18 because
02:16:19 even just regular porn just regular sex
02:16:22 it's strange that we all want to have
02:16:26 sex
02:16:26 but no one wants to see the person that
02:16:30 they have sex with having sex with
02:16:31 someone else on film
02:16:32 i know so even though you know that they
02:16:35 have had sex before
02:16:37 you're like blah blah blah blah blah i
02:16:38 can't hear it
02:16:42 it would be interesting to hear i mean
02:16:44 how
02:16:45 boyfriends of people who have done porn
02:16:47 i mean some guy i think some guys can
02:16:49 just handle it
02:16:50 and they can be okay you guys like it i
02:16:53 i like when i i like hearing about
02:16:56 if my ex boyfriend not porn but i would
02:16:59 if he made like sex
02:17:00 tapes with other girlfriends you'd want
02:17:01 to watch them
02:17:03 i would yes yeah i love it we got to put
02:17:06 these in a bank vault
02:17:08 i would watch them all the time i would
02:17:10 want to hear about them all the time i'm
02:17:11 really into that i
02:17:12 really love hearing about um
02:17:15 ex-girlfriends or
02:17:16 even um you know i hate to even say this
02:17:20 because it just
02:17:21 sounds ridiculous but and maybe i'm not
02:17:24 into it anymore but when i did the last
02:17:26 time i had a boyfriend years and years
02:17:27 ago i wanted him to
02:17:28 go have sex with other girls and like
02:17:30 tell me about it really
02:17:31 yeah and and dr drew has told me that
02:17:35 there's something wrong with me that
02:17:36 that's what i like like that's not
02:17:38 there's something wrong with dr drew how
02:17:39 about that
02:17:40 yeah maybe yeah he's not perfect he's
02:17:43 not
02:17:43 no um but i
02:17:47 i yeah i like that i like what did i say
02:17:49 what was wrong with you he said that
02:17:50 i that nikki he made me look him in the
02:17:52 eyes and tell tell him i'm enough
02:17:55 you are enough nikki look at me you are
02:17:57 enough
02:17:58 you are enough i don't want i don't want
02:18:01 my ex i don't want my boyfriend
02:18:04 to bang someone else because i don't
02:18:05 think that i can
02:18:07 be enough it's because i like i think
02:18:10 it's hot
02:18:10 i just think it's hot and i and i don't
02:18:12 feel threatened by it i really don't
02:18:14 because
02:18:15 most of the time if you let your ex if
02:18:17 you let your boyfriend bang someone else
02:18:19 they don't really want to it's like
02:18:21 almost like
02:18:23 giving them the license takes away the
02:18:25 fun the thrill
02:18:26 of cheating so it's kind of hard to find
02:18:28 guys that are into this and i don't
02:18:29 always want this
02:18:30 now listen to this podcast they're going
02:18:32 to come floating into your desk
02:18:33 i'm saying this for years and no one's
02:18:35 hit me up but the guys actually don't
02:18:37 like this because
02:18:38 they want they want their women to only
02:18:40 want them and it's not that i don't want
02:18:41 them
02:18:42 i want i if i'm i want girl
02:18:45 i'm very turned on by guys who other
02:18:48 girls want to fuck like i like
02:18:50 having a guy being like he's mine and
02:18:52 you you can't have him if you want like
02:18:54 i get him and i know you wanna fuck him
02:18:56 but you can't but actually you can
02:18:58 and he's gonna tell me about it later
02:19:00 and you're gonna think that you're gonna
02:19:01 like steal him from me but you're not
02:19:02 we're gonna talk about you behind your
02:19:04 back later on
02:19:05 and i want her to have a really good
02:19:06 time dr drew's right now just screaming
02:19:09 taking his headphones off mickey you're
02:19:11 enough you are you are enough
02:19:13 i know i'm enough but i just there's
02:19:16 it's just
02:19:17 um what did he how did he how did you
02:19:19 guys resolve the conversation
02:19:20 well he was the one that was told me
02:19:22 that i need to go see a therapist that
02:19:24 like helps me feel my feelings
02:19:25 i like found my therapist because dr
02:19:26 drew was like you need to go to
02:19:28 emotionally focused therapists because
02:19:29 you don't feel your feelings and you
02:19:30 need to find someone who like
02:19:31 really mimics your feelings back to you
02:19:35 mimics yeah because i don't really let
02:19:38 myself get sad or get
02:19:39 mad and i you know i just i kind of just
02:19:42 i'm always running from one thing to the
02:19:44 next because i don't like to
02:19:46 i don't like to feel at all interesting
02:19:49 yeah but it's but he just said that yeah
02:19:52 my
02:19:53 that compulsion to have but it's always
02:19:56 been there like
02:19:57 whenever i'm with a guy i want to hear
02:19:59 about like when was the last time you
02:20:00 hooked up what happened
02:20:01 where what did you do what like i want
02:20:03 to know all those things and they think
02:20:04 it's a trap they're like oh you're going
02:20:05 to get jealous and
02:20:06 this is going to lead to like fights
02:20:08 later on but
02:20:09 i want to like hear about it and talk
02:20:11 about it and i don't know it just it
02:20:13 really does it for me
02:20:15 i i it's it's a weird thing and he
02:20:18 rejects that yeah he thinks he thinks
02:20:21 that it's it means that i have low
02:20:22 self-esteem
02:20:23 which i'm not denying i do
02:20:27 but that's not what it is i don't but i
02:20:29 don't think that's where i mean maybe
02:20:30 that's where it comes from but it does
02:20:32 i don't think it is i think it's a
02:20:33 sexual kink yeah it's not i'm not a cuck
02:20:35 i'm not in the corner like
02:20:36 oh you're fucking my boyfriend like like
02:20:39 sad about like
02:20:40 oh could girl be a cock yeah i didn't
02:20:43 know a girl could be a cop i'm sure they
02:20:45 could
02:20:45 i i mean well if you're just like my one
02:20:48 would stop
02:20:48 fucking my boyfriend like i could see
02:20:50 that but no i'm like in the corner like
02:20:52 do it and i don't even want to be
02:20:53 involved i'm just like haha
02:20:56 i love it she's getting it and like and
02:20:59 i'm not
02:20:59 i don't i don't know why i'm not jealous
02:21:01 i first of all
02:21:02 i've been fucked by enough guys who
02:21:04 haven't wanted to be with me afterwards
02:21:06 so i don't think that my boyfriend's
02:21:07 gonna fuck someone and be like i need to
02:21:08 marry her if anything he's gonna be like
02:21:10 i need to get away from this ch like
02:21:12 it'll it'll
02:21:13 make him not want to fucking yeah yeah
02:21:17 that usually does it based on my
02:21:19 experience when you have sex with a guy
02:21:21 he doesn't really want to hang out with
02:21:22 you afterwards that is hilarious so the
02:21:24 way to keep your man
02:21:25 is to let him fuck other girls that way
02:21:27 he won't want to be with them anymore
02:21:28 yes and if he does want to be with them
02:21:30 go be with them well i don't want to
02:21:32 keep you from that
02:21:34 but i i just i have a lot of self-esteem
02:21:37 in terms of like
02:21:38 i'm a cool chick i feel like yeah i'm a
02:21:40 lot as you said on the last podcast and
02:21:42 i've never gotten them out of my head
02:21:43 no no i am a lot and that's a good thing
02:21:45 that that
02:21:46 bothered you when i said you're a lot it
02:21:48 didn't bother me but it
02:21:50 i felt seen joe wrote
02:21:54 yeah i felt like wow he i don't know
02:21:57 i i just i i
02:22:00 didn't know what to think of you before
02:22:04 we have hung out and we really only hung
02:22:06 out on the podcast which is like a
02:22:08 real hang i mean this is no different
02:22:10 than if we were alone together
02:22:12 and just hanging out as comics but um
02:22:15 yeah i just felt like my god you really
02:22:18 you just
02:22:19 you showed me a part of myself that i
02:22:20 was maybe denying because i just
02:22:22 picture myself like i'm such a cool
02:22:23 chick i'm so fun and easy like
02:22:25 why does anyone like me and then you go
02:22:27 well you're a lot and it was just like
02:22:30 fuck like maybe i'm not the total
02:22:32 package that i think i am and that's
02:22:33 okay
02:22:35 i'm alive a lot is not bad it's not
02:22:39 okay no it's not when i say you're a lot
02:22:41 it's like whoa there's a lot going on
02:22:42 there
02:22:43 it's not it's not but am i enough
02:22:46 are you enough look at me say you're
02:22:49 enough

02:22:56 lot joe say you're alive i'm alive you
02:22:57 know you're a lot
02:22:58 i don't you've said you're a lot the
02:23:00 whole podcast because well now i know
02:23:02 i'm a lot

02:23:29 of why you're such a good comic
02:23:30 it has to be it has to be those two
02:23:33 things have to be connected
02:23:34 yes all that madness is comes out in the
02:23:38 creativity and it comes down to your
02:23:39 writing and it comes out your
02:23:40 performance so yeah that's part of why
02:23:42 it's so good

02:24:49 good you don't want it what fuck would
02:24:51 you want to do with that thing
02:24:53 i mean i would like to host a late night
02:24:55 talk show some day
02:24:56 but will they be doing it on the
02:24:58 internet no one should ever
02:25:00 try to censor you no way what makes you
02:25:04 fun and interesting and special is you
02:25:07 all of you yeah all of you that you
02:25:09 showed here not some weird
02:25:11 proctor and gamble version of you that's
02:25:13 gonna sell tampons on some late night
02:25:15 bullshit
02:25:16 show the fuck out of here with that that
02:25:18 would be a waste of you
02:25:20 if you had to do the ellen degeneres
02:25:21 show it would be a fucking waste of you
02:25:24 right like if they get rid of ellen
02:25:25 because she's so mean and they bring in
02:25:27 nikki glazer and you have to pretend you
02:25:28 give a fuck about dancing for all these
02:25:30 people
02:25:30 i like dancing i bet you do but you'd
02:25:32 also like to talk about getting gagged
02:25:34 and
02:25:34 i know but i can and they'll never give
02:25:36 me that show because i've admitted this
02:25:38 these things but but that is what you
02:25:40 should talk about
02:25:41 i know but i could be more than those
02:25:43 things i could just say
02:25:45 i could save that for here no you are
02:25:47 all those things you can do
02:25:49 other things here as well right now i
02:25:51 mean here is in the internet yes yes
02:25:53 you can do other things that you could
02:25:55 talk about
02:25:56 everything you want to talk about not
02:25:58 just little segments
02:25:59 you have to save parts of it the the the
02:26:02 parts that are disturbing for some
02:26:03 people
02:26:04 save that for the people that get it
02:26:06 from my patreon subscribers i was gonna
02:26:07 say that
02:26:08 patreon but you don't have a latest
02:26:11 patreon
02:26:11 that that world is fucked that that
02:26:14 world of like
02:26:15 censored like you don't know the one of
02:26:18 the reasons why the ellen thing is so
02:26:19 fascinating to people when people find
02:26:21 out that she's mean
02:26:22 they're like like you know that's not
02:26:25 all she thinks about and talks about
02:26:26 when she's doing that show
02:26:28 right like if we found out that jimmy
02:26:30 fallon was secretly doing heroin and
02:26:32 fucking guys he'd be like i knew it i
02:26:34 knew you couldn't be that
02:26:36 that same guy all the time it's just two
02:26:39 two but that's what disney what why do
02:26:42 why why is that the way it is though i
02:26:44 don't think why do people
02:26:45 i don't think they do then why aren't
02:26:47 advertisers investing in people who are
02:26:49 being honest in
02:26:50 in well they are they're well now
02:26:52 they're on podcasts
02:26:53 yeah i have a lot of ads no i know you
02:26:56 do but this is you're leading the chat
02:26:57 people but this is
02:26:58 this is this is mainstream now like
02:27:02 the world of television like the
02:27:04 censored
02:27:05 view of things it's not viable anymore
02:27:09 because it's not real humans so that's
02:27:12 why the ratings are terrible
02:27:14 the ratings are terrible because it's
02:27:15 not compelling because you only scratch
02:27:17 the surface of human potential of
02:27:19 of a human personality of human interest
02:27:22 you only just
02:27:23 you dabble in this very shallow pool and
02:27:25 you're but oh we're swimming
02:27:27 look at us in here swimming stand stand
02:27:28 up it's ankle high
02:27:31 you're not swimming you're lying on your
02:27:33 stomach in a fucking kiddie pool
02:27:36 where other people are jumping into the
02:27:37 ocean of ideas and that's the difference
02:27:39 but don't we rest getting in so much
02:27:41 trouble with who i mean
02:27:44 yeah some ads look i'm sure well i know
02:27:47 for a fact i've said things on this
02:27:49 podcast where i've lost sponsors
02:27:51 but then more of them come in they take
02:27:53 their place yeah
02:27:54 like you're not a bad person you're a
02:27:56 good person that's what i keep
02:27:58 going back to because sometimes i feel
02:27:59 like a bad person
02:28:01 about the things i talk about you know
02:28:02 you're not no there's nothing about you
02:28:04 that's a bad person
02:28:05 you're just honest about the way your
02:28:08 brain works and everybody's brain works
02:28:10 differently
02:28:10 we're all weird we're all weird and
02:28:12 different but you don't know who's weird
02:28:14 that's why the ellen thing is so
02:28:15 interesting to people because like
02:28:17 she's mean she's secretly mean so she
02:28:20 pretends to be nice but she's
02:28:22 mean you know like if somebody
02:28:26 just pretends to be this version of
02:28:29 someone that we see in a mary poppins
02:28:31 movie or we see
02:28:32 in some sort of a disney television show
02:28:34 like that's
02:28:36 what freaks people out like like why is
02:28:39 that person
02:28:40 that like i think mr rogers was really
02:28:42 like that
02:28:43 i do too i think we were getting that's
02:28:45 he was honest yeah that was his honor
02:28:47 that really was him but that's so rare
02:28:50 but if you found out that mr rogers was
02:28:52 a secret cunt
02:28:53 you like to spit on people at red lights
02:28:55 you know like you'd be like what
02:28:56 mister that's why people are freaking
02:28:58 out about ellen because they're freaking

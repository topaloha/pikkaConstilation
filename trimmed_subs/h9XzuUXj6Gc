00:01:20 probably i feel like with all of the
00:01:23 fucking tension
00:01:24 like there was a story in chicago right
00:01:27 they thought it was a 15 year old girl
00:01:29 was shot by the police it turned out to
00:01:31 be a 20 year old man

00:01:59 know
00:02:00 we're not going to have an answer that
00:02:01 night no that's going to be a fun week
00:02:04 of not knowing who the president is
00:02:06 remember when it happened in 2000
00:02:08 no one cared it was funny yeah that we
00:02:09 didn't have a president
00:02:11 like there was all those snl skits and
00:02:13 you know everybody's making fun of it
00:02:14 there was no real unrest no in 2000
00:02:18 but now we cannot handle the uncertainty
00:02:22 of not knowing we need to know that
00:02:24 night yeah the dangling chads thing it's
00:02:26 no big deal yeah it was funny
00:02:27 everybody was wondering everyone was
00:02:29 like what what what are we doing
00:02:30 laughing
00:02:30 off we were all going we don't need a
00:02:32 president yeah whatever we were so much
00:02:34 more emotionally healthy as a country at
00:02:37 that moment than we are now
00:02:38 yeah this is funny but it is true yeah
00:02:41 because we laughed we go yeah who cares
00:02:43 yeah they go we're fine and but now it's
00:02:46 like
00:02:47 chaos and we need a break like we need a
00:02:50 break
00:02:50 whoever like everybody can't be a
00:02:52 political pundit
00:02:54 like my aunt cannot be writing about
00:02:56 trade
00:02:57 on facebook i think we just leave it all
00:03:00 to alyssa milano
00:03:01 yeah looking forward to her tweets in
00:03:04 november i'm just gonna follow all that
00:03:06 yeah yeah well she was like
00:03:09 she's got a podcast we know that she's
00:03:11 fine yeah
00:03:12 i mean it's relevance right they're all
00:03:14 trying to be relevant everybody's
00:03:15 relevant
00:03:16 like they have to be you have to get
00:03:17 your opinion out there it's super
00:03:19 important
00:03:19 and that's the way to be relevant now is
00:03:21 to just be
00:03:23 you know like be political all day every
00:03:26 day
00:03:26 when you go from actor to activist yeah
00:03:29 all in
00:03:29 very interesting as soon as the fucking
00:03:31 calls stop coming in you're like all
00:03:33 right i'm an activist
00:03:34 what's so funny is we know because we're
00:03:36 like in in this thing
00:03:37 that getting good at this whether it's
00:03:40 comedy or being an actor is very tough
00:03:43 you're not spending your life thinking
00:03:44 about other people let's just be real
00:03:47 for the most part
00:03:48 you're just not i didn't you're thinking
00:03:50 about your career yeah you're thinking
00:03:51 about your career i've spent the last
00:03:52 decade
00:03:53 thinking about myself my jokes how do i
00:03:56 get ahead
00:03:57 how do i get ahead how do i get on
00:03:59 television for
00:04:00 three minutes like so this idea that
00:04:04 these people are now going to pretend
00:04:06 that they've spent their entire career
00:04:08 thinking about global warming
00:04:12 it's just not true like i know these
00:04:15 people like i've met these people oh
00:04:17 yeah
00:04:17 and and my friends have opened for some
00:04:19 of these people and i know that like
00:04:21 these people are going out there and
00:04:22 they're like you know listen we got to
00:04:24 do this we got to do that they got to
00:04:25 move the country forward but i've seen
00:04:27 them
00:04:27 make people cry backstage at a theater
00:04:30 because there's not enough water in the
00:04:31 dressing room right
00:04:32 so it's those same people yeah that are
00:04:35 really cruel
00:04:37 going out and telling everybody how good
00:04:39 of a person they are
00:04:40 all the time well they find the pattern
00:04:42 they find the pattern the
00:04:43 the way they have to talk and the things
00:04:44 they have to talk about when they lock
00:04:46 into those things
00:04:47 with no deviation they find whatever the
00:04:49 line is where hollywood wants whatever
00:04:51 the line is always left
00:04:53 yes it's always super progressive always
00:04:54 super woke and they fucking
00:04:56 ride that line yeah like a fucking
00:04:59 railroad train just choo
00:05:00 choo straight down no deviation it's so
00:05:03 obvious
00:05:04 i know dudes i used to do open mics with
00:05:06 who like they're tweeting it
00:05:07 mayor garcetti they're tweeting
00:05:10 about the budget in l.a
00:05:13 they're like the budget's being passed
00:05:15 they're tweeting garcet
00:05:16 the budget i'm like god you can't you
00:05:19 don't have
00:05:21 the money to pay your rent like you have
00:05:22 no idea what's going on in the world
00:05:25 and you're tweeting at garcetti about
00:05:27 them and they're doing it so that they
00:05:28 can get a job
00:05:30 right they're doing it so that somebody
00:05:31 can see him and go you know what
00:05:33 he'd be you know he'd had a great
00:05:34 garcetti tweet he should write on bojack
00:05:37 horseman
00:05:39 that's the way it works it does kind of
00:05:41 work like that
00:05:42 i've i've i've just i've never been more
00:05:45 amused
00:05:46 it's very funny but i'm also terrified
00:05:49 it's very we're gonna die it has both of
00:05:52 those things
00:05:53 happening it's like part of me is
00:05:55 laughing at how stereotypical everybody
00:05:57 is
00:05:57 and how cliche yeah but then part of me
00:05:59 is like this is
00:06:00 terrifying like the the people at each
00:06:02 other's throats
00:06:04 people are enemies now like listen
00:06:06 people never loved each other because
00:06:08 it's a competitive business but like
00:06:10 i i know like people it wasn't nearly as
00:06:14 intense right as it is right now like
00:06:16 the feeling of like
00:06:17 if you disagree with somebody they are
00:06:20 your enemy
00:06:21 in comedy and they want you to not have
00:06:23 a job like
00:06:24 and i've never felt that way about
00:06:26 anybody i don't care what you
00:06:28 if you're funny i truly don't care
00:06:31 if you're a communist if you're out
00:06:33 whatever whatever you are
00:06:34 you're not you don't have any power it's
00:06:36 not like you're affecting my life
00:06:38 you can believe whatever you want if
00:06:39 you're funny you're funny i don't like
00:06:40 to say this in generalizations because i
00:06:42 don't think i don't believe in
00:06:43 generalizations but
00:06:44 right i love them i do too they're fun i
00:06:47 need them they're they're the best for
00:06:48 college yeah i mean we need them
00:06:50 without generalizations comedy kind of
00:06:52 stuff yeah but
00:06:53 more people on the left are doing this
00:06:56 than people on the right
00:06:57 yeah i don't see that many people on the
00:06:59 right i see a few
00:07:00 but i don't see as many people on the
00:07:02 right calling for people to get canceled
00:07:03 forever
00:07:04 but the people on the left are like burn
00:07:06 their house burn them to the ground
00:07:07 well the right will do it the right i
00:07:09 mean the q anon thing's kind of a way
00:07:11 they're doing it where they're like
00:07:13 david spade's got an ankle bracing on
00:07:15 and
00:07:16 he's in jail and trump's put everyone
00:07:18 under house arrest
00:07:19 like they're in this other thing where
00:07:21 it's like oh you guys have left the
00:07:22 planet
00:07:24 and you like so explained to people who
00:07:26 don't know
00:07:27 what this q and change well the q and
00:07:29 stuff is like there is this idea that
00:07:31 there's an intelligence dissemination
00:07:32 operation happening meaning
00:07:34 behind the scenes high-level
00:07:35 intelligence guys or military people
00:07:37 are leaking information about a shadow
00:07:40 war that we don't really see happening
00:07:42 and the shadow war involves trump and
00:07:45 the people on the side of lightness
00:07:47 battling the you know these deep state
00:07:50 pedophile
00:07:51 pedophile cannibals like i don't know
00:07:53 why like i don't never understood why
00:07:55 they have to be cannibals
00:07:56 i didn't know they were cannibals
00:07:58 they're no they're cannibals they're
00:07:59 eating children and then they get the
00:08:00 adrenal chroma it keeps them young
00:08:02 oh that's right so this whole thing and
00:08:03 then trump is going to war with all of
00:08:05 them
00:08:05 right now listen pedophilia is a big
00:08:07 problem they do
00:08:09 cover up shit at high levels 100 yes the
00:08:12 epstein stuff is 100
00:08:13 real 100 clinton's on that plane he's on
00:08:16 that island
00:08:17 26 times yeah the franklin scandal
00:08:19 there's scandals all over the world so
00:08:21 i'm not delegitimizing like
00:08:22 the idea of real human trafficking but
00:08:25 the idea
00:08:26 that donald trump is fighting human
00:08:29 traffickers
00:08:30 and the human traffickers are ellen who
00:08:33 is a little wild
00:08:35 that everyone in hollywood's eating
00:08:36 children and there's tunnels under
00:08:38 central paul i mean
00:08:40 it's hard to keep up with and the queue
00:08:42 drops so to speak are like these
00:08:45 these um you know they're like they're
00:08:47 like poems or they're
00:08:48 they're coded information so it's never
00:08:50 like hey this is what
00:08:52 you get these drops where do you get a
00:08:53 4chan or something you get them like
00:08:55 unfortunately okay but 4chan is the best
00:08:57 place in the world
00:08:58 for trolls you know it's a lot of fun
00:08:59 well that's what maybe this is this
00:09:01 could be like
00:09:01 that's what i'm saying yeah it could be
00:09:02 a high-level troll nobody knows because
00:09:04 it's bait it has
00:09:05 nuggets of truth right right just like
00:09:07 anything else right it has nuggets of
00:09:09 very real things the government is shady
00:09:11 as fuck
00:09:11 a lot of the elites are doing things
00:09:14 engaging in pedophilia
00:09:15 and probably worse yeah like i some of
00:09:17 those kids on epstein's island probably
00:09:19 did disappear
00:09:20 but the idea that like that that trump
00:09:23 is fighting this underground war and
00:09:24 it's all about human trafficking i just
00:09:26 don't think
00:09:27 that's borne out by the facts like
00:09:29 there's no facts
00:09:31 to point i mean trump was like friends
00:09:32 with the clintons for his whole life
00:09:34 well not only that if trump was doing it
00:09:36 and not talking about it it would be
00:09:38 so character like imagine this one thing
00:09:42 that he's doing that's the most noble
00:09:44 thing
00:09:45 that he's ever done ever right he's not
00:09:47 selfless
00:09:48 the most important the moment for
00:09:50 humanity and he's not even bringing it
00:09:51 up he's just secretly winking
00:09:53 yeah all the cue people well you know
00:09:55 and and so everything he does there's
00:09:56 like a reason that he does it they say
00:09:58 like when he wishes lane maxwell he goes
00:09:59 i wish her well
00:10:00 yeah now the thing is that's a rich guy
00:10:03 who's forgetting he's the president
00:10:05 who's just on a t at mar-a-lago because
00:10:06 that's how rich people talk
00:10:08 i mean that's literally and i've been
00:10:09 around a few like really wealthy people
00:10:11 this is how they talk when you say
00:10:13 something bad anything bad if you go
00:10:15 you know you know john's wife has cancer
00:10:17 you know that kid had a dewy he's got a
00:10:18 problem he had a couple incidents there
00:10:20 at harvard
00:10:20 they go like this guy i wish him well
00:10:22 tee off
00:10:24 that's that's how they talk that's how
00:10:26 they it's just a dismissal
00:10:28 it's a way to dismiss it but the q
00:10:30 people are like oh there's a meaning
00:10:32 there's hidden meaning right he's saying
00:10:34 that she's and if you look at
00:10:35 ivanka's wearing this dress and it means
00:10:38 and it's just like
00:10:38 listen i'm a conspiracy guy but this is
00:10:40 exhausting well
00:10:42 i don't think he's too much jacket the
00:10:44 jacket
00:10:45 yeah i don't care do you yeah isn't that
00:10:46 what it said yeah i don't care i don't
00:10:47 really care to you
00:10:48 right what yeah i mean it's weird fuck
00:10:51 is this yeah these are weird things what
00:10:53 are we doing so i think the trump
00:10:54 administration
00:10:55 feeds the trolls like i think they like
00:10:56 it i think he'll by the time the
00:10:58 election rolls around he'll be like full
00:11:00 full cue just leaning in who's who's
00:11:02 behind the scenes pulling the strings is
00:11:04 it ivanka
00:11:05 they say jared kushner has a lot of
00:11:07 power but wouldn't be funny if it was
00:11:08 ivanka doing the whole thing
00:11:10 she's the one like stroking her chin
00:11:11 like she's the boss what is the nugget
00:11:13 we release next
00:11:14 right she's q a she's the smart one
00:11:17 who's like
00:11:18 how do we how do we yeah she's the
00:11:20 pretty daughter
00:11:21 everybody dismisses her i mean nobody
00:11:23 takes nobody's right
00:11:24 right she's in the background on the
00:11:26 whole fucking show she's cute
00:11:27 black leather gloves on yeah that go to
00:11:30 the elbow
00:11:31 like the inspector gadget hand you just
00:11:32 see your hand typing on 4chan
00:11:35 send send yeah i don't i don't know man
00:11:38 you know steve bannon said something and
00:11:41 there was a documentary
00:11:42 about errol uh aaron morris made a
00:11:44 documentary about steve bannon he bannon
00:11:45 said this very interesting thing
00:11:47 he said you know there's a guy uh out
00:11:49 there who's got a horrible life like
00:11:51 he's divorced his kids don't like him he
00:11:52 has a shitty job
00:11:53 but when he plays like league of league
00:11:55 of legends or world of warcraft one of
00:11:56 these games
00:11:57 he's a hero and when he dies in real
00:11:59 life nobody really cares but when he
00:12:00 dies in the game
00:12:02 so many people come out and they like
00:12:03 you know they show him respect because
00:12:04 you're playing with people from all over
00:12:06 the world
00:12:06 so bannon's like which which life is the
00:12:08 real life
00:12:09 so which of course it's the real one
00:12:12 that you're living not this fantasy game
00:12:14 but i think the q anon thing i think the
00:12:16 trump administration is like yeah let
00:12:18 people believe
00:12:19 they're hunting pedophiles online it
00:12:21 gives their lives meaning
00:12:23 like let these people believe they're
00:12:24 like hunting the clintons it's like fun
00:12:26 it's like a fun video game for them and
00:12:28 then they don't have to ask why they
00:12:29 don't have health insurance and can't
00:12:30 get a knee operation
00:12:32 i don't think that it's that involved
00:12:35 i think it's just a thing that's
00:12:36 happening yeah that happens to fit in
00:12:38 with human nature
00:12:39 that's probably true too yeah like i
00:12:41 don't believe that the
00:12:42 trump administration has the resources
00:12:44 to do that but still
00:12:46 i mean they would have to be so 4d chess
00:12:49 they would they would really have to be
00:12:51 they may like encourage it a little i
00:12:53 think they may just
00:12:54 pour a little gasoline on it maybe yeah
00:12:57 maybe
00:12:57 why not if they think that's their base
00:12:59 yeah they're like why not they're having
00:13:01 fun
00:13:02 when you go out to a trump rally you
00:13:03 want a little fun oh for sure
00:13:05 yeah yeah it's the things that he does
00:13:08 that are mistakes
00:13:09 yeah like these these interviews that he
00:13:11 does where he or he'll argue
00:13:13 about shit like he'll he'll argue about
00:13:16 how well they're doing
00:13:17 or what you know what's wrong or what he
00:13:19 got right or what his iq
00:13:20 is or how well he did at this uh
00:13:23 intelligence test like
00:13:25 anybody who's playing like 3d chess is
00:13:26 not going to do that no
00:13:28 no he's not playing any chess he's going
00:13:30 back instinct he's
00:13:32 he's riffing and we've said it before
00:13:33 i've said it on the show before it's
00:13:35 like
00:13:35 it's amazing to watch a guy get up no
00:13:37 material
00:13:38 and just crush i mean just he's really
00:13:41 going by instinct he's like
00:13:43 perf he's perfectly suited for this era
00:13:46 yeah because he's like he he's
00:13:48 hypnotizing
00:13:49 like if you start listening to him he
00:13:50 can't stop like i'll try to watch one
00:13:52 five minute clip of an interview i end
00:13:54 up watching the whole hour yeah because
00:13:56 he's like there's a hypnotic thing
00:13:58 that's going on where he just is up and
00:14:00 down and you're just
00:14:01 you can't not listen have you ever seen
00:14:02 scott adams talk about him
00:14:04 no scott adams is an interesting guy
00:14:06 he's a very intelligent guy he wrote the
00:14:08 dilbert comics you know yeah so he's
00:14:11 basically saying that trump is like a
00:14:14 master persuader and scott adams
00:14:16 understands hypnosis
00:14:18 and persuasion and interesting he's
00:14:20 talking about the way the guy does it
00:14:22 and how he does it that he's a master
00:14:24 persuader a lot of people disagree with
00:14:25 him but
00:14:26 what's interesting is he's not he
00:14:27 doesn't even vote scott adams doesn't
00:14:29 vote
00:14:30 and he's not really a trump supporter
00:14:31 although he does say a lot of things
00:14:33 that seem to
00:14:35 like i think he he leans
00:14:38 towards trump being more persuasive than
00:14:41 just going by his gut
00:14:42 because he sort of fills his he's got
00:14:44 this theory
00:14:45 yeah that aligns with his theory so he
00:14:47 goes a lot i see him leaning into it a
00:14:49 little bit where it's not like he's
00:14:50 totally objective about it
00:14:52 but he's lost millions of dollars
00:14:54 because millions
00:14:55 really like people oh fuck yeah they've
00:14:57 turned on him he was saying on twitter
00:14:58 the other day that people uh slowed down
00:15:00 in front of his house started screaming
00:15:01 that he's a racist
00:15:03 jesus for nothing just because because
00:15:06 he said
00:15:06 that trump is persuasive right he said
00:15:09 that he thinks trump is essentially
00:15:12 pulling people strings and manipulating
00:15:14 people in a really interesting way
00:15:16 yeah and he is i mean like any president
00:15:19 does that
00:15:20 but trump does it extremely well he does
00:15:22 it a non-presidential way
00:15:24 right that's why it's weird yeah it's a
00:15:26 weird way of doing it he's a co
00:15:27 i love con artists and grifters and to
00:15:29 me trump is the highest level
00:15:31 biggest con ever most successful you
00:15:34 know without a question i mean like
00:15:36 you know he's the king of all of those
00:15:38 every guy sitting in an office
00:15:40 right now calling people up trying to
00:15:42 sell him shit over the phone
00:15:44 that's the trump's the kid trump's the
00:15:46 highest level that you can
00:15:47 i mean anybody i mean if you're using a
00:15:50 fake id
00:15:51 yeah to try to buy cigarettes up the
00:15:54 ladder
00:15:54 there's donald trump like all the way up
00:15:56 the lad and that
00:15:57 to me i think because everyone's like
00:15:59 he's evil or he's jesus
00:16:01 it's like i don't i don't look at things
00:16:04 that emotionally because i guess i'm
00:16:05 just not a total loser i think that's
00:16:07 really what it is
00:16:08 i think if your relief of nothing going
00:16:10 on
00:16:11 everything becomes about politics which
00:16:14 we don't
00:16:14 i'm never going to meet nancy pelo i
00:16:16 mean this is a television show right you
00:16:17 know i'm not saying that
00:16:19 real things don't happen that people
00:16:20 aren't affected but this day-to-day
00:16:23 like you're inundated with like he said
00:16:25 she's their policy schumer it's like
00:16:28 dude who cares my favorite pelosi
00:16:31 and schumer image of all time was them
00:16:33 with the african cloth yeah yeah
00:16:36 the enemies not realizing that the cloth
00:16:39 pattern they're wearing
00:16:40 was from a tribe that was notorious for
00:16:42 selling slaves
00:16:43 yeah yeah well notorious for being a
00:16:47 major part of the slave
00:16:48 yeah well so is the democratic party for
00:16:50 many years let's be honest that's what
00:16:52 people don't know
00:16:53 yeah that means when you go way back to
00:16:55 the democrats democrats were the
00:16:56 confederates yeah
00:16:57 whoops so and it's just we've been
00:16:59 looking at these people for too long
00:17:01 we've seen an image that's amazing i
00:17:03 love good but it's not as good as the
00:17:04 one when they're on their knees
00:17:06 i love the hands on the hips like oh and
00:17:08 the mask as well they've got everything
00:17:10 bitch yeah yeah it's beautiful and
00:17:12 someone was saying that like well you
00:17:14 have to respect nancy pelosi someone
00:17:15 said that to me and i said
00:17:16 she wants 16 year olds to be able to
00:17:18 vote they look by the way
00:17:20 like invaders it just came into a
00:17:21 country slaughtered people and
00:17:23 took their clothing hopped off of a boat
00:17:25 yeah they look like people that just
00:17:26 colonized an area and took their cloth
00:17:28 yeah they're they're wearing like swamp
00:17:30 boots so they don't step into my blood
00:17:32 how old is she a million she's a
00:17:33 millionaire i mean
00:17:35 dude does anyone retire does anyone step
00:17:37 away no you you die at a trump rally
00:17:40 like herman cain
00:17:40 yeah what are you gonna do respect to
00:17:43 herman cain
00:17:44 respect no matter godfather yeah yeah
00:17:47 went out there no mask
00:17:48 he does what he wants but yeah he had
00:17:49 cancer and knitting he had cancer i
00:17:52 think oh did he yeah
00:17:54 well he died of covet yeah if you have
00:17:56 covet and you die of cancer you still
00:17:58 huge die to cover hit by a car you die
00:18:00 to coven i don't think they do it that
00:18:01 far but well
00:18:02 you'll see we'll see there's going to be
00:18:04 a documentary in a few years about this
00:18:06 i don't know
00:18:07 new york times are saying today they
00:18:08 think it's underreported they think that
00:18:09 the covet deaths are somewhere around
00:18:11 200 000.
00:18:13 yeah i mean listen i mean at a certain
00:18:15 point you just
00:18:16 you have to stop reading because
00:18:19 everything you read every hour
00:18:21 contradicts the last thing you've read
00:18:23 yeah and they're like it's airborne no
00:18:25 it's not yes it is no it's not i'm like
00:18:29 what do i do you can get it off surfaces
00:18:30 no you can't just kill me
00:18:32 like i don't know what's happening well
00:18:34 they don't know that's the problem
00:18:36 they're making it up on the go because
00:18:37 they're getting new data all the time
00:18:39 they're constantly getting new
00:18:40 information
00:18:41 new studies new things show but they
00:18:42 don't react to all the studies like
00:18:44 one of the big ones is the fact that it
00:18:46 dies in sunlight so right if that's the
00:18:48 case well you should let people do
00:18:49 all sorts of outdoor activities these
00:18:51 studies when you read about the studies
00:18:53 they're like we sampled a certain amount
00:18:55 of people
00:18:56 and this is what we found and it's like
00:18:58 that's not necessarily indicative
00:19:00 right of anything well it's it's
00:19:03 information it's better than nothing
00:19:04 yeah and it depends on who's reading the
00:19:06 study and what their bias is
00:19:08 and what they're trying to say um but
00:19:11 it's clear that they're trying to figure
00:19:12 this out i mean obviously it's only been
00:19:14 around for
00:19:14 six seven months and they say that the
00:19:16 people that are really reacting to it
00:19:19 in many cases a lot like for whatever
00:19:21 reason their immune system has not had
00:19:24 as many prior experiences with
00:19:25 coronaviruses so if your immune system
00:19:27 has gotten a lot of colds and you fought
00:19:29 them off
00:19:30 supposedly you're in a better position
00:19:31 to deal with this than somebody who has
00:19:33 not had that
00:19:34 germaphobes are fucked yeah germaphobes
00:19:38 the fact that we were shaking hands and
00:19:39 on and off planes that might be good
00:19:41 that might have strengthened our immune
00:19:42 system well they were saying that about
00:19:43 people in prison
00:19:44 like one of the reasons why the people
00:19:45 in prison are doing so well with it like
00:19:48 when guys are in prison you would say oh
00:19:50 what a fucking
00:19:50 terrible place for your immune system
00:19:52 but uh was it huberman
00:19:54 was it uh andrew huberman was talking to
00:19:56 us about this
00:19:57 i think it was he was saying might not
00:19:59 have been him too many guests
00:20:01 they were talking about immune systems
00:20:02 in that when you
00:20:04 think of your immune system you think
00:20:05 well if you're you're healthy and calm
00:20:08 and well slept and you know you're not
00:20:10 stressed out that's when your immune
00:20:11 system is at its best well that's not
00:20:13 really the case
00:20:14 and those people that are in jail
00:20:15 stuffed in next to all these people
00:20:16 breathing in everybody's bacteria and
00:20:18 all the viruses and shit that's in the
00:20:20 air no escape from each other no way to
00:20:22 social distance those people actually
00:20:24 have
00:20:24 pretty strong immune systems they're
00:20:25 doing good because their immune system
00:20:27 is
00:20:27 like in shape so the la homeless
00:20:29 population has got to be great
00:20:30 oh yeah they're probably they probably
00:20:32 have a natural immunity you know they
00:20:33 have
00:20:34 typhus i don't know you know that i have
00:20:36 no idea
00:20:37 they found typhus yeah yeah it's a
00:20:40 middle-aged disease
00:20:42 like it's come back because of like the
00:20:43 conditions that the you're in
00:20:45 the feces middle age medieval let me
00:20:47 fuck that up every time i do that i'm
00:20:48 like this time i'm gonna get it right
00:20:50 nope i always say but they're doing good
00:20:51 with corona because they have strong
00:20:53 immune system so why don't we open the
00:20:54 comedy store up and just have the
00:20:55 homeless be the servers
00:20:58 like why can't we open up businesses in
00:20:59 la and just have the homeless
00:21:02 who've strengthened their immune systems
00:21:04 operate the businesses
00:21:07 let them shoot the voice
00:21:10 let homeless people go in and direct the
00:21:12 voice
00:21:14 i don't think they don't show up a lot
00:21:16 that's true they're
00:21:17 a good point liable they're unreliable
00:21:19 maybe you should have like three
00:21:20 homeless for each job
00:21:22 yeah like look someone's coming in
00:21:23 becky's ready becky's on standby
00:21:25 becca's over there shaking and
00:21:27 scratching
00:21:31 this is america's got talent there's 70
00:21:34 000 of them just in l.a
00:21:35 it's crazy they don't even know really
00:21:37 how many there are now because there's
00:21:38 70 000 of them before corona oh there's
00:21:40 going to be
00:21:40 there's going to be millions imagine if
00:21:42 there's a million homeless people
00:21:43 there's gonna be millions of homeless
00:21:45 people
00:21:45 it's gonna look very soon
00:21:48 like a and it's already starting to get
00:21:50 there like a movie
00:21:52 like a post-apocalyptic movie where you
00:21:54 drive down melrose
00:21:55 and everything's boarded up and you see
00:21:57 a lot like it's
00:21:58 gonna start looking really
00:22:02 bad here it could look really bad new
00:22:04 york is
00:22:05 a nightmare i've heard like new york the
00:22:07 crime is skyrocketing
00:22:10 and you know there's just
00:22:13 you know the the the relationship
00:22:15 between the police and the people is
00:22:16 very fraught and it's very hot i mean
00:22:18 it's like
00:22:18 so the police like fuck it we don't want
00:22:20 to do anything and you're like you
00:22:22 understand a lot of they're just like
00:22:23 listen we're gonna sit back and then now
00:22:25 a lot of areas are just being policed by
00:22:28 criminal elements by gangs and
00:22:30 stuff like that because that's what
00:22:31 happens in a power vacuum you know if
00:22:33 you get rid of
00:22:34 the cops i'm not saying this shouldn't
00:22:35 be reformed they shouldn't have all
00:22:37 these new regulations but like
00:22:39 if you defund them or get rid of them
00:22:41 somebody steps into that vacuum
00:22:43 and it's going to be usually a gang the
00:22:45 mafia
00:22:46 crime syndicate whatever dude de blasio
00:22:49 not good
00:22:49 if you think your mayor is bad de blasio

00:22:58 with a fork and what's great is that
00:23:01 he does he does yeah what's great is
00:23:03 that everyone hates them like the left
00:23:05 hates
00:23:05 them and that for different reasons and
00:23:07 then the right hates them
00:23:08 even the black lives matter people hate
00:23:10 them because they're all so pandering
00:23:12 what are you doing look at that oh
00:23:13 eating pizza with a fork he's disgusting

00:23:32 goofball
00:23:33 yeah and he gets up with his wife they
00:23:35 did like a rally right after coronavirus
00:23:37 and like she gets up and she goes power
00:23:39 to the people and then she thought like
00:23:42 it was going to be like a 60s rally yeah
00:23:44 and then the crowd was just stared at
00:23:45 her like
00:23:46 what the fuck we're gonna die ladies

00:23:50 they were gonna start beating
00:23:51 tambourines like power to the people
00:23:54 like
00:23:54 her and de blasio think they're like
00:23:56 living some historic
00:23:58 moment and though they are that's just
00:24:01 not what they just not what they think

00:24:15 the movement that is
00:24:16 not freedom of speech you can't do that
00:24:18 no that's anti-first amendment yeah but
00:24:20 this is a big part of who we are you

00:24:43 not only can people not protest
00:24:44 you can't leave your house without dying
00:24:46 like if you leave your house you get
00:24:47 skin cancer sauna life
00:24:48 yeah and they tried to do a protest it
00:24:50 lasted like sort of got less than three
00:24:52 blocks
00:24:52 they were like back like they were
00:24:54 banging a thing they were like no
00:24:55 justice
00:24:57 they were like no no pete like they had
00:25:00 no idea and then
00:25:01 they were sitting down you saw them like
00:25:02 sitting down eating ice
00:25:04 i am one hundred percent for police
00:25:06 reform hundred percent 100
00:25:07 i 100 believe there's too much police
00:25:09 brutality too much i am also
00:25:11 100 in in the belief that there's a lot
00:25:14 of people that are doing this
00:25:16 and following this movement because like
00:25:18 we were talking about before with actors
00:25:20 it is the trendy thing to do social and
00:25:22 then also
00:25:24 what you're seeing in like portland and
00:25:25 seattle you're seeing crazy white people
00:25:28 trying to light government buildings
00:25:29 yeah well they think if they if they
00:25:30 bash the windows of amazon this is the
00:25:32 beginning of the revolution
00:25:34 how is it at all connected to police
00:25:36 it's crazy
00:25:37 it is not connected at all it's just
00:25:39 anarchy it's just chaos
00:25:40 when you unleash that like in the
00:25:42 beginning of this like listen you burn
00:25:43 down a target it was fine i even laughed
00:25:45 i said it was a shit
00:25:47 it's in minneapolis like did this happen
00:25:48 in minneapolis so what a target gets it
00:25:51 in minneapolis the guy gets charged the
00:25:52 next day it's fine
00:25:53 but when you unleash total chaos you
00:25:56 know more about violence than anybody
00:25:57 you can't control it no you can't direct
00:25:59 it to the to the targets that you think
00:26:01 are
00:26:02 right it's also intoxicating and fun
00:26:04 right all those people that are involved
00:26:05 in it wearing masks showing up every day
00:26:07 having a good time they're giving their
00:26:08 it gives their life meaning
00:26:09 right it does they're trying to beat the
00:26:10 man right they're trying to break down
00:26:12 the fucking fence they put around the
00:26:13 federal building and they're trying to
00:26:14 light that bitch on fire using
00:26:16 bibles right they're lighting bibles on
00:26:18 fire jesus i mean it's all chaos
00:26:20 it's just insane how about the mayor of
00:26:22 seattle's like maybe this is our summer
00:26:23 of
00:26:24 love yeah there i've never been there i
00:26:26 don't want to ever go
00:26:28 like i have not the pacific northwest i
00:26:30 hate it i know you do i don't give a
00:26:32 fuck of those people
00:26:33 i don't care about those trees and the
00:26:35 trails and they all look like vampires
00:26:37 they're pale
00:26:38 and gaunt freaks they're so weird amway
00:26:41 that scam started up there like
00:26:43 multi-level marketing startup there yeah
00:26:45 they're all looking for something to
00:26:46 believe in and that's that
00:26:48 those are problem areas well that's
00:26:49 where brett weinstein was teaching at
00:26:51 evergreen
00:26:52 and they and that's where they came like
00:26:53 patrolling the campus with bats
00:26:55 looking for him he's like he's a as
00:26:58 literally as progressive as a human can
00:26:59 get right
00:27:00 and he's also a nerd yeah super nice guy
00:27:03 yeah and they you know they were coming
00:27:05 for him it's it's
00:27:06 i've never liked there's something about
00:27:08 the pacific northwest i've just never
00:27:10 i never connected with it i thought
00:27:11 about living there once yeah but i mean
00:27:13 that's your you love that stuff
00:27:14 i don't give a shit it happens all the
00:27:16 time i i know but that's why these
00:27:18 people are out throwing bibles at the
00:27:19 federal building
00:27:20 is because it's raining all the time
00:27:22 well i don't know what makes that place
00:27:24 so progressive and so left-wing but
00:27:27 the thing is is that like you saw hints
00:27:29 of this many years ago
00:27:30 where antifa would stop traffic yeah
00:27:32 like doing these things and stuff and
00:27:34 when people would they would get people
00:27:35 to say black lives matter it's like
00:27:36 what's the point is before that
00:27:37 they weren't they weren't connected with
00:27:38 black lives matter before
00:27:41 the coronavirus thing before george
00:27:43 floyd the antifa people
00:27:44 it was all about right-wing people it
00:27:46 was all about combating
00:27:48 right-wing folks right like the proud
00:27:49 boy they would have those skirmishes
00:27:51 exactly right well that's where the
00:27:52 proud boys came from they came from
00:27:55 speakers exactly they wanted someone to
00:27:58 fight back against antifa when he was
00:27:59 shutting down
00:28:00 correct people who are speaking at
00:28:02 colleges who are right-wing people like
00:28:04 milo
00:28:05 or anybody whatever yeah those kind of
00:28:07 people so that's where it all came from
00:28:08 in the first place but
00:28:09 when you would go to seattle they were
00:28:11 letting these fucking people
00:28:13 direct traffic or was it portland it
00:28:15 might have been portland
00:28:16 they were letting these fucking people
00:28:17 direct they were telling people you
00:28:18 can't go down this road
00:28:20 yeah and so this old man was like i'm
00:28:22 going and they started chasing him and
00:28:24 they kicked his ass they're beating on
00:28:25 his fucking car
00:28:26 yeah i don't know why people on twitter
00:28:28 defend that
00:28:29 and i don't know why a lot of
00:28:30 celebrities defend it and i don't
00:28:32 understand why
00:28:33 a lot of mainstream democrats don't just
00:28:35 call that out for what it is i've never
00:28:37 once seen
00:28:38 a mainstream republican ever i mean
00:28:42 defend like the proud boys or or or that
00:28:45 was certainly not their hill to die on
00:28:47 like right if a mainstream republican
00:28:48 defended them it was very like it was a
00:28:50 huge news story
00:28:51 usually i don't know why i think the big
00:28:54 problem is
00:28:55 it's like things are happening you see
00:28:57 them with your own eyes and then people
00:28:58 tell you
00:28:58 that they're not happening right they're
00:29:00 like no that protest is peaceful you're
00:29:01 like
00:29:02 i saw them light a guy on fire and use
00:29:04 him as a battering ram to get into
00:29:05 macy's
00:29:06 they're like well you know he gave them
00:29:08 a look there's always a qualifier
00:29:10 it was this weird qualifier yeah they're
00:29:12 like well here's what happened you're
00:29:14 like they were beating a child they're
00:29:15 like
00:29:16 let me explain what happened yeah they
00:29:18 were gathered together
00:29:19 they had burning bibles bows and arrows
00:29:21 bike locks and chains
00:29:22 that child crossed the street that child
00:29:25 said my dad's a cop
00:29:26 you see the child starting you're like
00:29:28 no
00:29:29 there's always a weird like but they
00:29:32 first they're the thugs of the left wing
00:29:34 they're they're doing the dirty work
00:29:36 that the left wing wants to get
00:29:38 they're like theater kids they're like
00:29:39 people that failed at stand-up comedy in
00:29:41 theater and
00:29:42 they moved back to portland from la and
00:29:44 now they're like let's burn it all down
00:29:45 i didn't get a comedy central half hour
00:29:47 you've never seen them really what it is
00:29:49 you ever see the ones that are
00:29:51 practicing self-defense no they train
00:29:53 they actually train
00:29:54 they're like they were these antifa
00:29:56 people were meeting in the park and they
00:29:57 were getting ready for skirmishes with
00:29:59 the right-wing people
00:30:00 this is all pre-coveted right when this
00:30:02 was funny right you know right right
00:30:04 this was funny when it stopped being
00:30:05 funny was uh how do you pronounce his
00:30:07 last name
00:30:08 go andy no andy yeah yeah yeah when andy
00:30:10 no got beat up and then they
00:30:12 shaked him and people were mocking and
00:30:13 i'm like hey why do you think it's okay
00:30:16 to beat this guy up like
00:30:17 why do you think it's okay to steal this
00:30:18 guy's camera like yeah what is that no
00:30:20 one is saying this
00:30:21 yeah then i started to say like okay
00:30:23 this is this is gonna be a real problem
00:30:24 and then the economy got shut down and
00:30:26 you can and you're like oh this will
00:30:27 only make
00:30:28 this bigger yeah and bigger yeah this
00:30:30 will only fuel the fire
00:30:31 but again it's like these people who'd
00:30:33 go there whether they're trying to light
00:30:34 the federal building on fire
00:30:36 or direct traffic they have a purpose
00:30:38 now
00:30:39 they have a thing and they have a cause
00:30:41 right like when they took over that
00:30:43 six sec six block section of portland or
00:30:46 seattle rather yeah
00:30:48 yeah or what was it that ch chow what
00:30:50 what
00:30:51 it was jazz or chop chop chop chop
00:30:54 but it started as jazz but young
00:30:57 countries often
00:30:58 have you know they changed leadership
00:30:59 hiccups and as they developed
00:31:01 i was gonna have that guy on my show the
00:31:02 guy razz yeah i was too then i got
00:31:04 caught with a gun
00:31:05 i know he was handing a a ak to someone
00:31:08 or whatever i still would have had him
00:31:09 but we couldn't get a zoom link working
00:31:11 i was going to have him here in person
00:31:12 really yeah interesting that would have
00:31:14 been fun
00:31:15 maybe yeah i was like listen man i
00:31:18 support you
00:31:19 do you know doing your thing but you
00:31:21 can't bring it out of the gun it's like
00:31:23 and i didn't even then they shoot dude
00:31:24 they shot two people there
00:31:26 well i don't know he didn't shoot well
00:31:27 he didn't somebody definitely did
00:31:29 the other thing they were doing that was
00:31:31 crazy was they basically became a really
00:31:33 shittily run country
00:31:35 they put up borders almost immediately
00:31:38 immediately
00:31:38 barriers they weren't borders when
00:31:40 people were doing things they didn't
00:31:41 want them to do they were the worst case
00:31:43 of police brutality they just beat the
00:31:44 fuck they just beat people up so if you
00:31:45 were trying to film them
00:31:46 doing something they didn't want you to
00:31:47 film they just kick your ass well this
00:31:49 is just like if you believe in something
00:31:51 really fervently not not like it's
00:31:54 always the ends justify the means like
00:31:56 however you get there it doesn't matter
00:31:57 right like anything's justified in the
00:31:59 pursuit of this utopia that you think
00:32:01 you're going to erect
00:32:03 in downtown seattle well it's also
00:32:05 you're doing for seven blocks
00:32:07 what you think shouldn't have been done
00:32:09 to america you're occupying land
00:32:11 right you're taking over existing
00:32:12 structures you're kicking out the
00:32:14 indigenous people of seattle
00:32:16 yeah i think i you know the shitty thing
00:32:18 is like electoral politics isn't perfect
00:32:20 but that's what you have to do like look
00:32:22 at cortez
00:32:24 she got elected you know like the people
00:32:27 that believe the things you believe
00:32:28 can get elected they have to work within
00:32:30 the system
00:32:31 because all the violence that chaos will
00:32:33 do will give the government a reason to
00:32:34 even clamp down more
00:32:36 now they got people and throwing people
00:32:37 in advance in portland the dhs because
00:32:40 again you're not going to overthrow the
00:32:41 government right you're not gonna
00:32:42 overthrow the military it's not the way
00:32:43 it's gonna work right they can catch you
00:32:45 breaking
00:32:46 public property it's just gonna be an
00:32:47 excuse for them to clamp down
00:32:49 more and it's gonna where we're gonna be
00:32:51 in more of a police state than we were
00:32:53 yeah the idea that when they did that
00:32:56 that somehow another incited the
00:32:57 violence to get worse like that is i
00:32:59 don't know if that's true
00:33:00 no it was it was chaos every night for
00:33:03 50 days
00:33:03 i'm not for the unmarked vans i think
00:33:05 that's a bad i think all of those things
00:33:08 end up being because look at what
00:33:11 happened after 9 11 they said we're
00:33:12 going to do this this and this and then
00:33:14 all of a sudden
00:33:15 nobody got any rights back by the way
00:33:17 your emails are still being read you
00:33:19 have no privacy
00:33:20 all of that's still there so if we just
00:33:22 establish a precedent of like yep some
00:33:24 people need to get thrown in a van
00:33:25 and we'll explain we'll explain uh why
00:33:28 that is
00:33:28 yeah that becomes a major problem going
00:33:31 forward did you see when they got thrown
00:33:33 into vans how excited everybody else was
00:33:34 what's your name what's your name we'll
00:33:36 get you out friends right it's like
00:33:38 you guys are all on luke skywalker this
00:33:41 is what happened
00:33:41 the resistance when you shut a country
00:33:43 down for three months this is the only
00:33:44 fun left
00:33:45 yeah nothing's open anymore the only fun
00:33:48 fun thing to do is to overthrow the
00:33:50 government get thrown in the van
00:33:52 yeah this is summer vacation to people
00:33:55 yeah this is a you know they used to
00:33:56 have those dumb escape rooms that people
00:33:58 used to do
00:33:58 escape rooms you shut the fuck up
00:34:00 they're stupid i love them but this is a
00:34:02 real one
00:34:03 this is a fun real one now it is a fun
00:34:06 how fun is that how do you like the
00:34:07 federal building
00:34:08 now it's now it's a real one yeah yeah
00:34:10 it's uh it's interesting man and i
00:34:12 wonder how these people are going to
00:34:13 transition into regular grown-up life
00:34:15 afterwards well i think that's shit joe
00:34:19 i think regular grown-up life to ship
00:34:21 itself on both sides like
00:34:23 the people that were in charlottesville
00:34:24 marching around like we're gonna have a
00:34:26 white country
00:34:27 we're gonna i mean these people they
00:34:29 will not replace us yeah they will yeah
00:34:32 it's like those people are as well
00:34:34 you'll never please
00:34:36 the far left and the far right right
00:34:37 like you'll never like the people that
00:34:39 are really on the fringes
00:34:41 you're never going to make them happy
00:34:43 like kamala harris by the way
00:34:45 is a fine vp choice yes we're all going
00:34:47 to get put in jail
00:34:49 yes she's going to put you in jail but
00:34:51 guess what who is he going to pick
00:34:54 elizabeth warren who lied about being a
00:34:56 native american
00:34:57 like kamal is good because the people in
00:34:59 the middle
00:35:00 don't care that she's a cop no one gives
00:35:02 a shit
00:35:03 no one cares you might care that she
00:35:04 locked up people but the republican
00:35:06 conventions could be very tough
00:35:08 to really get people mad at kamala
00:35:10 harris they're gonna be like
00:35:11 fuck come all everyone's gonna go yeah
00:35:13 they're gonna go she's a cop and she
00:35:14 locked up minorities he'll probably just
00:35:16 go
00:35:18 ah
00:35:21 is this a real problem like i just think
00:35:25 what do you think you think she's the
00:35:26 worst i don't think she's the worst
00:35:28 but uh i think it's it's very int well
00:35:32 somebody wrote on twitter that the left
00:35:35 is
00:35:35 very much against sexism and racism
00:35:39 yet they elected someone or they chose
00:35:41 someone to be a bp based entirely on
00:35:43 their sex and their race
00:35:45 right but we knew that was going to
00:35:47 happen we knew that was this is why all
00:35:48 these people on twitter and guys that i
00:35:50 really like like i really love kyle
00:35:52 kalinski and those people
00:35:53 but it's like they were like so mad
00:35:54 about it i'm like guys didn't you see it
00:35:55 was gonna happen
00:35:56 didn't you didn't you like ever it's the
00:35:59 most predictable choice in history
00:36:01 i was thinking if they went nuclear
00:36:03 michelle obama that would have been wild
00:36:04 right right right right right
00:36:05 one they would have won they would have
00:36:07 won and cuomo from new york like
00:36:09 meatball the governor of new york
00:36:10 meatball and michelle obama
00:36:12 win did you see the latest cuomo thing
00:36:14 no what's he doing now
00:36:16 kyle kalinski sent me this i mean he's
00:36:18 out of control over there
00:36:19 him and his bro his brother pretended to
00:36:21 have coronavirus by the way
00:36:22 they pretended well his brother chris
00:36:24 cuomo said he beat coronavirus by doing
00:36:26 chest exercises what swear to god
00:36:28 there's a youtube video where chris
00:36:29 cuomo is going
00:36:30 you know this virus gets in your body
00:36:31 and wants to stay there but you know
00:36:32 what you just start stretching your
00:36:34 chest
00:36:34 doing this you get rid of it that's
00:36:36 literally i mean he's never forget liar
00:36:38 liar
00:36:39 is that true yes he's alive you're gonna
00:36:41 stretch your chest yes if you can find
00:36:42 it jamie it's real
00:36:43 and he said he cured himself he cured
00:36:45 himself by doing chest exercises
00:36:47 and stretching his lungs out well the
00:36:49 worst part was when he pretended to come
00:36:51 out of the basement for the first time
00:36:53 when he had already been in a in a
00:36:54 fucking fight with some guys no these
00:36:56 people
00:36:56 on the bike they're pathological liars
00:36:58 both of them i don't think that's what
00:37:00 the case is
00:37:01 okay this is my take from a person who's
00:37:02 worked in show business for a long time
00:37:04 i think he had a producer that had at
00:37:07 cnn and they had this shot scheduled
00:37:09 you're going to we're going to film you
00:37:10 coming out of the basement it's going to
00:37:12 be amazing you're going to race your
00:37:13 family for the first time
00:37:14 in two weeks okay did the producer make
00:37:16 it pretend to have
00:37:17 a virus protecting his wall street
00:37:19 donors from democratic tax bills
00:37:22 um so this is uh but the tweet i sent
00:37:25 you jamie
00:37:27 but i didn't send you the tweet here it
00:37:29 is new disclosure records show andrew
00:37:31 cuomo's
00:37:31 largest headphone hedge fund donor just
00:37:34 funneled huge money
00:37:35 to the governor precisely the moment
00:37:37 cuomo has been blocking
00:37:39 democratic legislators bills to
00:37:41 reinstate new york's financial
00:37:43 transactions tax
00:37:45 that's crazy that is crazy
00:37:49 it's nuts if that's the tr if that's the
00:37:52 case
00:37:52 if like he knew that tax was coming
00:37:55 and he blocked it just so that he could
00:37:57 get paid
00:37:59 i don't know enough about financing i
00:38:00 don't know houses
00:38:03 tell me i was a subprime mortgage guy i
00:38:05 mean i know these things
00:38:06 i mean what i mean you're my guy i go to
00:38:08 yeah well good
00:38:10 i mean i i i i it's very possible that
00:38:13 he did block it so he could get paid i
00:38:14 mean these people give themselves raises
00:38:16 constantly no matter what circumstances
00:38:18 are
00:38:18 no matter what shortfall the city
00:38:20 government's in these people constantly
00:38:21 give themselves raises yeah and cuomo's
00:38:23 got to play an interesting game because
00:38:25 wall street money is how new york is
00:38:26 even alive if enough wall street people
00:38:28 leave you they're fucked well they're
00:38:30 fucked right now they're fucked right
00:38:31 now
00:38:31 fifty percent of the taxes in new york
00:38:33 are paid by the rich right and they're
00:38:35 leaving like one percent of the people
00:38:36 pay fifty percent of that yeah a lot of
00:38:37 them went to the hamptons a lot of them
00:38:39 got out of the city and a lot of them
00:38:40 were leaving the city
00:38:41 forever right so you you know you could
00:38:44 shit on the rich blah blah i think a lot
00:38:45 of them should
00:38:46 you know a lot of them get get out of
00:38:49 paying taxes by routing their money
00:38:51 offshore and they do a lot of things
00:38:52 they shouldn't do
00:38:54 but that tax base is essential
00:38:57 for that city 100 100 100 and this is
00:39:00 where and also
00:39:01 foreign criminals as sad as it is
00:39:04 third world dictators chinese amusement
00:39:06 park tycoons russian oligarchs
00:39:08 and assorted murderers you need their
00:39:11 money
00:39:12 yeah otherwise how you gonna sell stock
00:39:14 that's the reality like they have to
00:39:15 come in and launder their money
00:39:17 through new york real estate they got to
00:39:19 come in and buy 10 apartments they don't
00:39:21 use
00:39:22 and then their daughter goes to nyu i i
00:39:24 mean otherwise that whole city is going
00:39:26 to fall apart it's not right or wrong
00:39:27 good or bad
00:39:28 it's like it's just what's gonna happen
00:39:29 it's just what it is did you see cuomo
00:39:31 trying to bring the rich people back
00:39:32 it's like come on over i'll cook yeah
00:39:34 i'll cook he they're go he's a goon how
00:39:36 many people are you cooking for bro he's
00:39:38 an idiot this is that folksy horse shit
00:39:40 that they do like i'll make a meatball
00:39:42 for you it's like i'll cook for you yeah
00:39:44 how about
00:39:44 not letting the city get destroyed how
00:39:47 about not sending sick
00:39:48 old people to the nursing home where
00:39:50 they can infect everybody else well that
00:39:51 i was for
00:39:52 i think a good i think a good brush fire
00:39:54 through the nursing homes is good
00:39:56 to be honest with you oh god i mean my
00:39:59 mother's in a nursing home her
00:40:00 her roommate had covered for a month
00:40:04 my mother never got it every day they
00:40:05 would go in and they were like well you
00:40:07 my mother's an annoying woman loud
00:40:08 looks like me every day they walked in
00:40:10 they're like will you die
00:40:12 she's like i feel great so we're all
00:40:15 hoping second wave
00:40:16 but um it's like
00:40:20 it's you know she won't die the woman's
00:40:22 300 pounds she won't die
00:40:24 she won't die what is she eating
00:40:27 everything
00:40:28 probably her roommate who dyed a coconut
00:40:30 she's probably eating her
00:40:31 but the woman won't die she's indeed
00:40:33 fatigable like they
00:40:34 they can't great yeah i i whip it out
00:40:38 here i don't know say it right i don't
00:40:40 think i said i couldn't say medieval
00:40:42 yeah here he is here it is this is how
00:40:44 he beat corona
00:40:45 i don't think that i think he's just
00:40:46 talking about the tightness no no no no
00:40:48 no
00:40:48 he is stop defending him
00:40:52 i have to defend all this this is insane
00:40:54 because i have too much of that in me
00:40:56 this is
00:40:56 this is the vaccine for coronavirus by
00:40:58 the way going like this stretching he's
00:41:00 stretching
00:41:01 stretching i like how the stairs are
00:41:02 behind him yeah it's all
00:41:04 horseshit he looks fine he's probably
00:41:06 upset yeah it's probably sad
00:41:07 he's not sick he's like he goes you know
00:41:09 he goes this fires gets in he wants to
00:41:11 kill you but he goes you know what i do
00:41:13 he goes i just stretch the lungs stretch
00:41:15 the lungs then and it's like okay so we
00:41:17 shut down the economy
00:41:19 for three months for a virus where you
00:41:20 can just stretch your lungs you can
00:41:22 stretch the lungs and then that's it
00:41:23 something's off well this virus is
00:41:26 fucked up because yeah if you talk to
00:41:28 some people it's nothing
00:41:29 and i know people that have gotten it
00:41:31 they're fucked and they're not and other
00:41:32 people that have gotten it and they're
00:41:33 fucked still
00:41:34 right like i think michael yeoh is still
00:41:36 having a problem with fatigue my man
00:41:38 my ex managers uh his wife got it she
00:41:41 still can't smell
00:41:43 whoa how long ago three months she still
00:41:45 she can smell a few things
00:41:47 jesus i know is she healthy yeah she's a
00:41:51 thin
00:41:52 you know middle-aged woman yeah it's
00:41:55 weird and they are also saying that
00:41:57 some large number of people that get it
00:42:00 they still they have uh heart damage
00:42:02 so after it's over they show like that
00:42:05 baseball player there's a professional
00:42:06 baseball player that has to sit out the
00:42:07 rest of the season
00:42:09 he got checked out i mean i think he's
00:42:11 29 years old or something like that
00:42:13 and they found out that he has uh some
00:42:14 inflammation in his heart
00:42:16 nobody knows why any of this is
00:42:19 happening well i take it back to brett
00:42:20 weinstein again because
00:42:21 yeah brett who's a biologist was saying
00:42:24 that this disease has
00:42:25 all the markers of a disease that's been
00:42:27 manipulated for research
00:42:28 right that's why it does it's so
00:42:31 infectious now manipulated for research
00:42:33 like manipulated so that they can
00:42:34 research it or manipulate it as like how
00:42:36 can we make something dangerous that
00:42:37 might be a weapon
00:42:38 no they manipulate it so that they can
00:42:40 do research on it so they can find out
00:42:42 what kind of cures they can create for
00:42:43 coronavirus
00:42:44 interesting the lab that they did uh
00:42:46 research at was in wuhan and it's a
00:42:48 level four lab by a research facility
00:42:51 and they had been cited in 2018 for
00:42:53 safety violations they're getting real
00:42:54 sloppy over there because when you're
00:42:56 working under communism you don't have a
00:42:57 lot of incentives
00:42:58 right right a lot of money
00:43:02 is true it's very possible that it this
00:43:04 is a genetically
00:43:06 modified virus and that and maybe that's
00:43:08 why it has all of these different
00:43:10 effects on people
00:43:11 exactly exactly and it's probably
00:43:13 morphing like they say the one in india
00:43:15 is so different that if we come up with
00:43:17 a vaccine for
00:43:18 the american version it's not going to
00:43:19 work on the indian version
00:43:21 is this just the rest of the for the
00:43:22 history now is just
00:43:24 viruses and pandemics and like i mean
00:43:26 this seems to be
00:43:28 because all the conditions for this you
00:43:31 know
00:43:31 are are are are you know gonna still be
00:43:35 there
00:43:35 like they're still gonna be these wet
00:43:36 markets they'll still be
00:43:38 uh you know a lot of unsafe handling of
00:43:40 of of of
00:43:41 produce and and not only produce but
00:43:43 like you know different types of animals
00:43:46 and
00:43:47 so this may not be the end of this maybe
00:43:49 the beginning of an
00:43:50 era of just different types of pandemics
00:43:52 and viruses well they've been warning us
00:43:54 about this for a while yeah bill gates
00:43:56 had that ted speech
00:43:57 yeah in 2015 he said it's coming yeah
00:43:59 and you know now he's the devil now
00:44:00 everybody's like bill gates
00:44:02 i just think people get weirdly
00:44:04 uncomfortable when it's like
00:44:05 billionaires want to do like bill gates
00:44:07 was considering once shooting a missile
00:44:09 of dust at the sun
00:44:11 to help climate change this is a fact
00:44:13 what
00:44:14 yes so he was considering this and then
00:44:17 yeah where'd you read this this is what
00:44:19 kind of dust
00:44:20 uh how big the sun is yeah but bill
00:44:22 gates was considering
00:44:24 shooting a missile full of dust at the
00:44:26 center so it's like now obviously people
00:44:27 said to him hey
00:44:28 not a good idea and he relented but when
00:44:31 you have these batman
00:44:33 villain billionaires not that they're
00:44:34 evil but that they have a lot of money
00:44:36 they can do whatever they want
00:44:37 people get uncomfortable with just one
00:44:40 guy
00:44:41 saying this is the way it is and this is
00:44:43 what you need people just feel
00:44:44 uncomfortable you find that
00:44:45 is that real that's real joe could
00:44:48 dimming the sun save the earth bill
00:44:49 gates wants to spray millions and tons
00:44:50 of dust into the stratosphere okay
00:44:52 that's different
00:44:52 to stop global warming but critics fear
00:44:54 it could triple calamity
00:44:55 yeah that's not at the sun but what that
00:44:57 is the suspending particles in the
00:44:59 atmosphere they're going to act as like
00:45:00 understood but the reality is people get
00:45:03 a little
00:45:04 they get a little uncomfortable when a
00:45:06 billionaire from a lair
00:45:08 is decided to start shooting dust into
00:45:10 the atmosphere
00:45:11 and you know where is where is the is
00:45:14 there any democratic
00:45:16 process here where anybody will ever
00:45:18 have any say in anything ever again
00:45:21 or are we just going to listen to bezos
00:45:22 and him do it in there they could do
00:45:24 whatever they want well it's hard to say
00:45:25 because when you're that rich we listen
00:45:26 anyway
00:45:27 because we figured bezos has got 200
00:45:29 billion
00:45:30 or something he's must know something
00:45:32 that we don't know we assume
00:45:33 sure but i mean smarter than who knows
00:45:35 what you know
00:45:36 also they have a lot of money i don't
00:45:38 even think they want more money i think
00:45:39 a lot of them just
00:45:40 they want more well some of them do but
00:45:42 they also have they just have designs in
00:45:44 the way they want the world to look
00:45:46 they have an ideology i trust bezos more
00:45:48 than i trust bill
00:45:49 because bezos doesn't wear a uniform
00:45:51 bill gates wears that
00:45:52 mr rogers uniform yeah i don't trust it
00:45:55 i don't
00:45:55 i trust warren buffett because i feel
00:45:58 like he's in omaha just eating
00:46:00 eggs he lives in the same fucking house
00:46:02 that he bought like that's a scam no
00:46:04 he does that he does that so guys like
00:46:05 us would be like what a down to earth
00:46:07 guy like but he's a billion dollars
00:46:09 lives in a 400 000
00:46:10 house something's wrong that makes me
00:46:12 more suspicious than i would be if he
00:46:14 had a man he should have a big match
00:46:15 bill gates well that's not even his
00:46:16 regular outfit the regular that's the
00:46:18 regular outfit yeah
00:46:20 he's a little sweater with the shirt
00:46:21 what are you doing it's 100 degrees bill
00:46:23 what do you wear then you know do you
00:46:24 wear the same sweater with the shirt
00:46:26 look he's got that fucking he loves it
00:46:28 but why is that that's the tech outfit
00:46:29 man that's the silicon valley they're
00:46:31 gonna
00:46:32 people just get very nervous with
00:46:33 silicon valley billionaires
00:46:35 well it's an incredible amount of money
00:46:37 and it's an incredible amount of
00:46:38 influence people are
00:46:39 really worried about mark zuckerberg
00:46:40 yeah these guys are the new rockefeller
00:46:42 carnegie
00:46:43 and he's fucking really young he's
00:46:45 really young by the way speaks perfect
00:46:47 mandarin
00:46:48 well he's got a girl who's he's twice

00:47:20 just a white guy he's doing it
00:47:21 he's the guy from facebook speaking
00:47:23 perfect mandarin wow but he's ready
00:47:25 that's comforting by the way he's going
00:47:27 to bring them all the head of
00:47:28 the head of facebook is yucking it up
00:47:30 with you know maybe our biggest enemy
00:47:32 yeah that's nice
00:47:33 he's going to be super excited about new
00:47:35 world order give me some volume on this
00:47:43 [Music]
00:47:46 the translation is america will be a
00:47:48 prison we
00:47:50 will send your government to rule hour
00:47:52 this is what happens when you're like a
00:47:54 genius and you don't get laid in college
00:47:56 and you just say you know what i'm just
00:47:57 going to take over the world this is
00:47:58 like pinky in the brain but the real
00:48:00 thing well he's also
00:48:01 a guy who is friends with the people who
00:48:04 put together
00:48:05 facebook yeah that's a great movie
00:48:07 social networking i didn't see the movie
00:48:08 but i really like
00:48:09 articles real story the actual real
00:48:12 story is kind of fucked up
00:48:13 yeah he kind of well there were those
00:48:16 winklevoss twins and they had this
00:48:17 harvard
00:48:18 dating app or something and then
00:48:19 zuckerberg came in i think zuckerberg
00:48:21 had more of a vision of what he wanted
00:48:23 it to be but it was certainly sketch
00:48:25 it's a little sketchy the way that
00:48:27 happened yeah but the fact that they're
00:48:29 trying to do money now they're trying to
00:48:30 do facebook bitcoin like uh
00:48:43 i don't know how it's still relevant
00:48:44 like when you go on facebook now it's
00:48:45 just still crazy people screaming
00:48:48 yeah and and and they've still kept them
00:48:50 all on there they've kept them on there
00:48:51 like zuckerberg's figured out a way to
00:48:52 keep the boomers on facebook
00:48:54 yeah just sharing recipes and and
00:48:57 complaining about
00:48:58 you know yeah they're just talking about
00:49:00 cuda my aunt's like save the children
00:49:02 and here's a recipe for banana bread
00:49:04 my aunt's like there's tunneled under
00:49:06 central park and i'm making a banana
00:49:08 cream pie later
00:49:09 so if you want the recipe i mean
00:49:10 literally it's recipes and q drops
00:49:12 that's my aunt's face
00:49:14 i mean it's her head is melted i've
00:49:16 talked to multiple people that really
00:49:18 truly believe
00:49:19 in the q and on stuff well some of it
00:49:21 some of it listen some of it you gotta
00:49:23 give him the benefit of the doubt it's
00:49:24 like
00:49:24 i don't even blame the q and on people
00:49:26 as much because like
00:49:28 if you were ignorant of everything and
00:49:30 you never thought anything was
00:49:31 conspiratorial and then epstein and all
00:49:33 this stuff happen your mind would melt
00:49:35 oh yeah and that's what happened they
00:49:36 just i've been listening and following
00:49:38 weird shit
00:49:39 i mean i remember when 911 was a big
00:49:41 thing now nobody even care like you
00:49:42 bring that up people roll their eyes
00:49:44 remember that things change that was a
00:49:46 huge thing and it was like we're going
00:49:47 to get the answers and then people just
00:49:48 stop caring
00:49:49 and then you move on to this and then in
00:49:51 five years q and on people be like
00:49:53 they'll stop
00:49:53 caring and then it'll be another thing
00:49:55 and eventually you just have to like
00:49:57 kind of check
00:49:58 out because it gets boring well you kind
00:49:59 of wonder
00:50:01 disinformation campaigns have existed
00:50:02 forever where they take legitimate
00:50:04 information and then they
00:50:05 lump it in with nuts yes crazy shit
00:50:08 crazy people and crazy shit
00:50:09 and then they put it out there because
00:50:10 it taints all the legitimate information
00:50:12 as well 100 percent you know there's a
00:50:14 great book uh behold the pale horse you
00:50:16 ever read yeah william cooper or
00:50:18 something yeah yeah yeah
00:50:19 you read some of it and you go oh this
00:50:20 makes sense and then you go what what a
00:50:22 fucking alien base on the moon like
00:50:23 what's going on yeah
00:50:24 yeah and then some of it just goes left
00:50:26 it gets really crazy yeah it's
00:50:27 patrice o'neal like a great point where
00:50:29 he's like the people will be
00:50:31 they'll then they'll say two things that
00:50:34 make a lot of sense and then they'll put
00:50:35 marbles up their ass
00:50:37 that's the way he said it but it was
00:50:39 true and he said it on o a it was like
00:50:41 but it's hard but eventually just for
00:50:42 your own mental health you got to check
00:50:44 out yeah you got to just go you know
00:50:45 what there's more to life
00:50:47 than politics and there's just more to
00:50:49 life than hunting
00:50:51 this conspiracy forever because it's not
00:50:53 none of what you think is going to
00:50:55 happen is going to happen
00:50:55 i think that's part of what you you just
00:50:57 nailed it though there's more to life
00:50:58 but there's not for some people yeah
00:51:00 some people if they put on a fucking
00:51:02 maga hat
00:51:03 and they you know they have fucking uh
00:51:06 liberals with a line through it
00:51:08 and they go out there and they fucking
00:51:09 yeah that's it and they get to the rally
00:51:12 i was i was out there in the desert they
00:51:14 had all these women and they're in you
00:51:15 know mercedes like
00:51:16 beautiful day not as hot as it usually
00:51:18 is women in like top-down mercedes you'd
00:51:21 think like on a day like that you just
00:51:22 go out take a drive
00:51:23 put an album on go take a drive yeah up
00:51:26 the mountains
00:51:26 beautiful instead they had these pink
00:51:29 women for trump flags
00:51:30 and they all met on a corner and they're
00:51:32 all waving their flags and it's like
00:51:34 golf people it's like like middle
00:51:37 you know upper middle class golf people
00:51:40 and this is their sports it was like
00:51:41 high school spirit night
00:51:43 i wish her well yeah
00:51:44 [Laughter]
00:51:46 yeah that's what it is and and it's just
00:51:48 like the again i
00:51:50 thank god i found comedy thank god i
00:51:52 have something i like to do yeah
00:51:54 because i maybe i'd be somewhere with a
00:51:56 flag waving a flag running around
00:51:58 that's what it is right right like i
00:51:59 need things to do nobody has hobbies
00:52:02 not only does nobody have hobbies where
00:52:03 right now no one has a job that's a
00:52:05 problem
00:52:06 so there's like no money coming in
00:52:08 you're desperate you're scared
00:52:09 yeah you're blaming other people
00:52:11 everybody else you don't know who the
00:52:12 fuck is to blame
00:52:13 you have no idea and then there's a
00:52:15 disease that might kill you
00:52:17 yeah so that you you're anxious yeah
00:52:19 you're depressed yeah
00:52:20 your social circle has been cut
00:52:22 dramatically dramatically and
00:52:24 now the only thing you could do is kind
00:52:25 of go online for 19 hours a day and get
00:52:28 radicalized
00:52:29 in whatever direction that's the thing
00:52:31 that bothers me too
00:52:32 about like whenever people talk about uh
00:52:35 whether it's conspiracy theorists or
00:52:37 whatever
00:52:38 the one thing that drives me nuts is
00:52:40 that people say we have to stop these
00:52:42 conspiracy like
00:52:42 when all these covid conspiracies were
00:52:44 going around that well that's a
00:52:46 different one right because
00:52:47 i guess some of them could be actually
00:52:49 responsible for people
00:52:51 making poor choices none of those people
00:52:52 were going to make good choices before
00:52:54 that
00:52:55 that's my point yeah it's like if
00:52:56 there's people out there that are
00:52:58 pushing
00:52:58 ridiculous conspiracy theories like who
00:53:01 are you worried about are you worried
00:53:03 about it getting to you right no
00:53:05 you're not right you're not worried
00:53:06 about you believing it right so you
00:53:08 think you're smarter than everybody else
00:53:10 yeah well i think it's just people get
00:53:11 deeply uncomfortable
00:53:13 with the idea that they're losing
00:53:14 control of the public sphere
00:53:17 the public space right for so long you
00:53:20 had these
00:53:20 these mainstream media outlets they had
00:53:23 real direct control
00:53:24 i mean everything you saw everything you
00:53:26 watched everything you read it was
00:53:27 under the control of a relatively small
00:53:29 amount of people
00:53:30 and this was how it was forever right i
00:53:33 mean this was not like
00:53:34 an aberration this was literally how it
00:53:36 was forever every single thing you read
00:53:38 or saw
00:53:40 was curated by a small group of people
00:53:43 and now it's the wild west yeah
00:53:46 and a lot of people don't and you're
00:53:48 gonna get bad information you're gonna
00:53:49 get good information you're gonna have
00:53:50 to figure out which is which
00:53:51 and the country is not good at doing
00:53:54 that people are not good at doing that
00:53:56 and so people get worried and they're
00:53:58 like wait a minute but you can't put the
00:54:00 genie back in the bottle
00:54:01 well the problem is they can right and
00:54:03 they will
00:54:04 pandemic and all these different things
00:54:06 yeah and the video of the bunch of
00:54:08 doctors talking about hydroxychloroquine
00:54:10 and z-packs and and that woman who's a
00:54:12 witch doctor i liked her
00:54:13 i like that witch doctor and i want to
00:54:15 hear more about i find her
00:54:16 opinions on on on demons fucking you
00:54:19 more interesting than kova she needs a
00:54:21 podcast she needs a pi i don't care
00:54:23 about hydroxychloroquine i want to know
00:54:25 who are these demons who fuck you in
00:54:26 your sleep we should have her on you and
00:54:27 me

00:54:31 you and her would be phenomenal we could
00:54:34 fly her and she wouldn't even wear a
00:54:35 mask

00:54:37 cop at lax
00:54:39 where does she would be great i have no
00:54:40 idea where where does that look where
00:54:41 does that woman live

00:59:47 like that type of intense
00:59:49 yes yes yeah yeah the apocalypse they're
00:59:52 into that
00:59:52 so many people just really love that
00:59:55 vivid imagery from like book of
00:59:56 revelation yes
00:59:57 they want that yes that's the only part
00:59:59 of the bible a lot of them care about
01:00:01 yeah they just want the end they think
01:00:02 it's coming what's going on here give me
01:00:03 something
01:00:04 give me some of this what is she saying
01:00:07 you know one of us that yes we gave our
01:00:08 life to christ but we've been living in
01:00:10 sin
01:00:11 right oh no we did no we believe that
01:00:14 god exists but we've never surrendered
01:00:16 our all to him
01:00:18 it's unreasonable that's not reasonable
01:00:21 but because of the
01:00:21 case don't be afraid to give your all at
01:00:23 christ i'd feel comfortable if she
01:00:25 walked into a
01:00:26 hospital waiting room and started
01:00:28 treating me i'd feel very comfortable
01:00:30 and then she brought that guy out
01:00:32 and she goes now meet my uh nurse this
01:00:34 is my head nurse
01:00:35 you know what is interesting though is
01:00:37 this
01:00:38 the politicalization is that a word oh
01:00:40 this
01:00:42 [Music]
01:00:48 that's de blasio's wife trying to get
01:00:50 trying to get a response from people
01:00:51 inside
01:00:52 to the people nothing yeah yeah
01:00:56 yeah you gotta wonder
01:00:59 it's a real nightmare out there it's
01:01:01 weird yeah it's really weird if we can
01:01:03 stay alive it's awesome though as long
01:01:04 as nobody love dies in this
01:01:06 it's a good deal yeah i think if we come
01:01:07 out on the other end which i think will
01:01:08 be next spring i think we could go
01:01:10 through the fall and winter it's going
01:01:11 to be weird the election's weird like
01:01:13 have you ever
01:01:14 have you ever looked forward to three
01:01:15 months less no then these three months
01:01:17 of just intense i have intense anxiety
01:01:20 about the election
01:01:21 right like i'm where i'm like yeah this
01:01:23 could be bad
01:01:24 could go could go interestingly it could
01:01:26 be a real mess in this country
01:01:28 i think it'll be a mess no matter who
01:01:30 gets in i'd be less of a massive biden
01:01:32 i think if biden wins it'll be less of a
01:01:34 mess and i think people will shut i'm
01:01:36 hoping people will shut
01:01:37 up like can people just shut up
01:01:40 they're not gonna shut up yeah they're
01:01:42 not gonna shut up because first of all
01:01:44 the trump people if biden wins they're
01:01:45 gonna be furious
01:01:46 right and uh trump has said that like
01:01:48 that this mail-in vote thing is gonna be
01:01:51 right for fraud he's not maybe he's not
01:01:53 wrong about that either
01:01:55 i don't know enough about it but i don't
01:01:57 know why we can't have a regular
01:01:58 election with masks
01:02:00 uh well i don't know why we can't
01:02:01 entertain this scene as how you and i
01:02:02 don't know what the fuck we're talking
01:02:04 about let's just go all in
01:02:05 and say uh i believe it could be a fraud
01:02:08 wait the mail in yeah i think it could
01:02:10 be two
01:02:10 i think they should vote online how come
01:02:12 you could do banking
01:02:14 because then russian trolls and chinese
01:02:16 trolls and all the trolls and bots
01:02:18 meanwhile you bank online no problem
01:02:20 what what's more important you than your
01:02:21 money nothing nothing it's a good point
01:02:23 meanwhile they figured out how to do
01:02:24 that let's just have a regular election
01:02:26 six feet distancing mask
01:02:28 spray everything down in between i mean
01:02:30 what are we doing the phone
01:02:31 opens up with your face right yeah mine
01:02:33 does at least or your fingerprint why
01:02:35 can't you use that well i just
01:02:37 i agree with you but i don't know why we
01:02:38 can't have a traditional regular
01:02:40 election with masks and distancing
01:02:42 we certainly can i think we can i think
01:02:44 it's stupid not to
01:02:45 especially in an election that's going
01:02:46 to be this contentious anyway we should
01:02:49 probably just have a regular election
01:02:50 with masks and distancing
01:02:51 i wonder what it's going to be like at
01:02:53 the polls and then like if really
01:02:54 elderly people
01:02:56 yes you should go to nursing homes
01:02:57 they're really elderly people and let
01:02:59 them
01:03:00 let them touch a computer screen like
01:03:04 let my mother go in there and let my
01:03:05 mother touch it because she loves trump
01:03:06 she asked me the other day
01:03:08 she goes can you get me a maga hat i'm
01:03:10 like yeah yeah
01:03:11 she's schizophrenic but she loves her
01:03:13 she's kind of his base
01:03:14 she does she does she goes
01:03:18 yeah she goes um uh yeah she goes i love
01:03:22 trump she goes he's just trying to do
01:03:23 the right thing for the country
01:03:24 you know i'm gonna take a picture of you
01:03:26 in full stride she goes your aunt donna
01:03:28 doesn't understand that donald trump's
01:03:29 trying
01:03:30 to save us from the people that want to
01:03:31 hurt us i was like yeah

01:06:16 it doesn't seem nice it's very
01:06:18 forced and whatever you're allowed to be
01:06:19 a bitch right you're allowed to be a
01:06:20 bitch you're allowed to be nasty to
01:06:22 people you're accomplished you're a
01:06:23 comedian you did the whole thing
01:06:24 what you're not allowed to do um is
01:06:27 have a guantanamo bay situation in the
01:06:30 backstage of your show where

01:07:08 don't go away
01:07:10 you got it you got to have a good run
01:07:12 and when you have a good run you step
01:07:13 back and you go okay

01:07:16 not i mean there's only a few jobs in
01:07:17 entertainment right right
01:07:18 so i think a lot of the cancer culture
01:07:20 shit is probably these motherfuckers
01:07:22 want those jobs
01:07:23 they're like how long is this bitch
01:07:25 gonna be dancing i can dance with
01:07:27 hillary clinton

01:07:34 out there to the charleston she's got
01:07:35 war criminals
01:07:36 her and bush are jumping around i mean
01:07:38 right she was buddies with bush now
01:07:39 she's a
01:07:40 cia agent stephen paddock
01:07:43 and do not ask me for sources but
01:07:45 stephen stephen paddock
01:07:48 who's that he was the guy that shot up
01:07:50 the vegas
01:07:51 concert that was very tragic listen to
01:07:54 this
01:07:54 the only guy that saw stephen paddock
01:07:56 alive his name is jesus compost
01:07:58 he was a guard at mandalay bay he got
01:08:00 interviewed nowhere else you know where
01:08:01 he got interviewed in the beginning
01:08:03 ellen ellen really weird and then they
01:08:06 went on if you could find that clip
01:08:08 they went on with a weird like diagram
01:08:10 of how it happened and ellen's like
01:08:12 showing the people out
01:08:13 not like an emotional like how are you
01:08:15 feeling how are you holding up it was a
01:08:16 weird diagram of like and then he went
01:08:18 to the left and to the right
01:08:19 it was very strange to look what the
01:08:21 hell is going on
01:08:23 this is a daytime show which is the
01:08:25 paddock guy and
01:08:26 there's two guys the chubby guy is the
01:08:28 jesus guy and now ellen is doing a doc
01:08:30 thing of of how the shooting happened
01:08:32 look how she's got like an antenna from
01:08:33 someone's buick that she's popped out
01:08:35 and she's using it as a pointer
01:08:37 but why the hell is this happening on
01:08:38 like a daytime show where she did this
01:08:40 is weird where'd she get that pointer i
01:08:42 don't know she stole it off
01:08:43 she stole it off an intern's car why
01:08:45 wouldn't you just use your finger
01:08:47 like if that was you if it was your show
01:08:49 and shit yeah wouldn't you just point
01:08:50 yeah yeah this is also a giant uh screen
01:08:53 behind her so they could have just put
01:08:54 it on that screen
01:08:55 so but she's using this thing i find it
01:08:57 very strange i don't know why
01:08:59 those aren't real palm trees
01:09:02 i know that street though i know that
01:09:04 block of beverly hills that she is how
01:09:05 weird is that i don't know why they're
01:09:07 doing this on a daytime talk show let's
01:09:09 keep it running
01:09:09 look at it she's dressed like colonel
01:09:11 sanders not colonel sanders she's just
01:09:13 like sergeant pepper this guy looks like
01:09:15 a member of her staff
01:09:16 what kind of outfit is she wearing i
01:09:18 don't know she wears it where's those
01:09:20 weird like militant
01:09:21 lesbians that should tell uniform yeah
01:09:23 but that's an odd look with all those
01:09:25 buttons
01:09:25 like why do you have so many wrist
01:09:27 buttons it was given to her and langley
01:09:29 the only reason why you have that many
01:09:30 wrist buttons if you're looking at
01:09:31 clothes on somebody yeah look at her
01:09:33 look at her everyone says she looks so
01:09:34 friendly she looks yeah she looks
01:09:35 friendly
01:09:36 she does look very military yeah she's a
01:09:38 militant woman
01:09:39 with a very expensive watch she dealt
01:09:41 with a lot of discrimination when she
01:09:42 came out it was very sad but then she
01:09:45 joined the cia her house got broken into
01:09:47 while she was at home
01:09:48 really yeah yeah she got a dope place in
01:09:51 montecito
01:09:52 and said and then they broke in while
01:09:53 she was there yeah and those people are
01:09:55 still being tortured to this day
01:09:56 probably they're still in an underground
01:09:58 jail yeah she's feeding them to her
01:10:00 staff
01:10:01 she's like it's okay don't worry about
01:10:03 it because you did good
01:10:04 is that the guy the survivor he's the
01:10:06 guy who met paddock
01:10:07 she's holding on to him it's odd yeah
01:10:09 she's allowed to do that because she's a
01:10:10 woman but if there was a man holding
01:10:12 onto a woman's arm that long
01:10:13 it'd be rape
01:10:16 be a real problem yeah that's for sure
01:10:20 so weird man what a strange interview
01:10:22 man i mean
01:10:23 the whole situation was strange what a
01:10:26 strange thing they never really figured
01:10:28 out why that guy did that there was no
01:10:29 motive
01:10:30 he has a very little footprint online he
01:10:32 was a chick he was in the philippines
01:10:34 yeah he was he made a lot of money doing
01:10:36 that jamie's just what did you do
01:10:37 jamie knows you don't know you don't
01:10:39 believe what do you think that's what
01:10:41 they said well i don't know you tell me
01:10:42 what's going on
01:10:43 okay but you just made a noise like this
01:10:45 is bullshit professional gamblers
01:10:47 not that's a lot of professional
01:10:49 gamblers buddy not about playing video
01:10:50 poker
01:10:51 is that what he does yeah that's all he
01:10:53 did yeah he was an arms dealer no i
01:10:55 don't know that
01:10:56 but i just see the way i said it very
01:10:59 definitively
01:10:59 he was an arms dealer yeah he did have a
01:11:02 lot of fucking guns
01:11:03 some it's just very strange and a lot of
01:11:06 times what happens is
01:11:07 you know just give him a check for 25 oh
01:11:10 well good for her
01:11:10 big ass check too like you won the lobby
01:11:12 that's good
01:11:14 yeah imagine if you won the lotto when
01:11:15 they gave you a check that big and it's
01:11:16 25 grand by the way after taxes that's
01:11:18 not even any money how about i put us
01:11:19 it's like nothing like bitch how about
01:11:21 you give me some real money yeah
01:11:23 and not eight thousand dollars when we
01:11:26 would give people fifty thousand dollars
01:11:27 to win fear factor
01:11:28 yeah the government i think takes
01:11:30 sixteen yeah that's crazy
01:11:32 you get thirty four dude when you do
01:11:33 your first job in comedy you have to
01:11:35 join sag which is three thousand dollars
01:11:37 so a lot of times you're like negative
01:11:38 yeah you have to pay three grand to join
01:11:40 the screen actors guild yeah and then
01:11:42 you're fi i mean it's wild
01:11:43 well this what they're doing right now
01:11:45 in california taxes they're trying to
01:11:46 retroactively tax everybody
01:11:48 up to 16.8 percent which is hilarious
01:11:50 yeah it's crazy you're going back to
01:11:51 january
01:11:52 yeah you know i know you were living
01:11:54 here over the last seven months
01:11:56 assuming that your tax rate was what it
01:11:58 is and you budgeted for that but
01:12:00 no we're going to steal your money are
01:12:03 they going to be able to do that
01:12:04 i don't know they're proposing they're
01:12:05 saying 16.8 percent for top
01:12:08 earners yep and then it's going to be
01:12:11 high no matter what because it was 13
01:12:13 yeah and a lot of people will be paying
01:12:15 14. it's a lot of money to go to
01:12:16 to a state that doesn't manage money
01:12:19 well and doesn't seem to fix any of the
01:12:21 problems especially if you're that guy
01:12:22 that's got that multi-million dollar
01:12:23 house in front of fucking tents
01:12:25 and you're like what am i doing yeah
01:12:26 what am i doing i work my fucking ass

01:12:52 kids yeah but no it's it's falling apart
01:12:54 here very quickly

01:12:57 far can it fall apart because i would
01:12:58 have not
01:13:00 it can fall further okay it will fall

01:15:15 people that go
01:15:17 they know what restaurants they're going
01:15:18 to get like if you go they want yeah or
01:15:20 or or any of those and the food in a lot
01:15:23 i like craigs but a lot of those beverly
01:15:25 hills restaurants it's not good
01:15:26 well it's a scene it's a scene yeah it's
01:15:28 exactly what it is but the food is like
01:15:29 you go this is horrific like if you go
01:15:31 to nobu and malibu they don't let them
01:15:33 on the property
01:15:33 yeah so they're on the street yelling at
01:15:35 you they yell at you yeah yeah yeah
01:15:37 so there's like the parking lot yeah and
01:15:38 then there's the restaurant are you
01:15:39 gonna miss that stuff are you gonna miss
01:15:40 like the no board now
01:15:41 like the food like the sushi no no i eat
01:15:45 meat
01:15:45 i know i eat meat and i don't like fish
01:15:47 you don't like food it's okay
01:15:48 i eat it when there's no meat around
01:15:50 yeah my dad's friend owned the
01:15:51 steakhouse he said that he was fishing
01:15:53 his bike
01:15:53 because fish is perfectly good if
01:15:55 there's no meat yeah i like meat well
01:15:57 the good thing about fish is you could
01:15:58 eat it all day long and no one gets mad
01:15:59 at you
01:16:00 if you eat meat people think you're a
01:16:01 terrible person meanwhile there's plenty
01:16:03 of cows and we're sucking fish out of
01:16:04 the ocean in record numbers
01:16:06 but the ocean's going to be drained of
01:16:08 of sashimi yeah but no
01:16:10 you know what no no generation before us
01:16:12 ever worried about us so it's like i'm
01:16:13 going to eat the sashimi and the kids
01:16:14 can figure it out let the tick tock
01:16:16 fucks figure out how to get more salmon
01:16:17 but there's no shortage of cattle like
01:16:20 you can get
01:16:20 broken isn't the problem that they fart
01:16:22 and then it causes methane i mean i know
01:16:25 that that was the case but then they did
01:16:26 an actual uh a survey see if you find
01:16:28 that
01:16:29 they did some sort of a satellite image
01:16:31 of the united states they found out that
01:16:32 the large majority of
01:16:34 methane release is coming from dumps and
01:16:37 coming from
01:16:38 yeah which is interesting of course it
01:16:40 does all that food and everything's
01:16:42 rotting and it's just going straight up
01:16:43 well yeah
01:16:44 all of those you know people criticize
01:16:46 me because it's political but
01:16:47 what's very interesting is like sugar
01:16:49 gets away with everything
01:16:50 yeah sugar is like a like there was a
01:16:52 comedian who did a great joke
01:16:53 it was baron vaughn and it was like he
01:16:55 goes cocaine and heroin look at sugar
01:16:57 and go fuck that's the fucking
01:16:58 dude that's the real drug he's
01:17:00 everywhere yeah i mean that's the real
01:17:02 markets
01:17:03 yeah so i mean sugar is just so endemic
01:17:06 in our culture that
01:17:08 and it's not that political and it is
01:17:10 very addictive oh yeah really
01:17:12 shafir did this and uh big j elkerson a
01:17:14 few people
01:17:15 we did this slim fast challenge for like
01:17:17 two weeks and you read the slim fest
01:17:19 ingredients all sugar
01:17:20 yeah you're just drinking a chocolate
01:17:21 milkshake yeah it just doesn't have much
01:17:23 calories other than the sugar
01:17:24 right and it fills you up in some weird
01:17:25 way what do you got jamie what is that
01:17:27 research shows removing all livestock
01:17:30 and poultry from the u.s
01:17:31 alone would only reduce global
01:17:33 greenhouse gas emissions by
01:17:36 0.36 percent you
01:17:38 fucks just relax if you don't eat those
01:17:42 cows
01:17:43 they die on their own and no one gets to
01:17:44 eat them right that's the problem
01:17:46 yeah so you got to eat the cows yeah
01:17:48 this idea that you're going to save the
01:17:50 world that was something that was
01:17:51 promoted by a lot of these bullshit
01:17:52 propaganda vegan movies
01:17:53 right that if you like greenhouse gases
01:17:55 are all coming from that no
01:17:56 no no look a lot of greenhouse gas is
01:17:58 coming from shipping produce folks
01:18:00 right it's unfortunate it's true agreed
01:18:02 there's a lot of problems with growing
01:18:04 things
01:18:04 like almonds that you're using so much
01:18:07 fucking water to grow these things right
01:18:09 you drinking almond milk what's your
01:18:10 feeling on home
01:18:11 i drink almond milk what you're feeling
01:18:12 on whole milk i think
01:18:15 raw milk is probably good for you what's
01:18:17 wrong
01:18:18 it doesn't bother me non-homogenized
01:18:21 non-pasteurized where do you find that
01:18:22 you can only get it in some stores
01:18:24 it's kind it's kind of wrong i mean it's
01:18:26 like yeah it's like finding dmt
01:18:28 yeah that's what i was about to say i'm
01:18:30 like sometimes you'll bring up a product
01:18:31 i'm like how do you even get that
01:18:33 i was drinking raw milk for a while
01:18:35 because you could get it at the
01:18:36 supermarket i think you get it at whole
01:18:37 foods but it was good for literally like
01:18:39 two days
01:18:40 does it taste good it tastes great
01:18:41 interesting it's really thick
01:18:43 and like you drink it and it doesn't
01:18:45 make you feel like shit like there's
01:18:46 something about
01:18:47 regular milk which i love like milk and
01:18:49 cookies you give me a fucking chocolate
01:18:51 chip cookie and a cold glass of milk
01:18:53 whoa yeah it's so good you dunk it in
01:18:55 are you a dunker do you dunk
01:18:57 i have dunked boa has a dessert where
01:18:59 it's those warm cookies and they're just
01:19:01 a little scoops no ice cream it's like
01:19:02 uh it's a problem
01:19:03 it's a very good real good very good
01:19:05 thing but when you drink regular milk
01:19:08 your stomach's like all right we can
01:19:09 deal with it right whatever
01:19:11 but whole milk it just kind of goes in
01:19:14 there because it has all the enzymes
01:19:15 it's not boiled down when your body is
01:19:18 drinking pasteurized homogenized milk
01:19:20 the idea is
01:19:20 it can stay on the shelf longer it could
01:19:22 feed more people it also lasts longer
01:19:24 keeps people from getting sick i get it
01:19:26 all that stuff's good
01:19:27 but the problem is that your body
01:19:29 doesn't know what that is
01:19:30 like that's boiled and dead there's no
01:19:33 enzymes in it
01:19:34 when you drink regular milk it's like
01:19:36 your body's like oh we know what to do
01:19:37 with this
01:19:37 this is raw milk this is milk it's not
01:19:39 this pad like pasteurization
01:19:41 exactly yeah okay yeah that's all yeah
01:19:43 and you don't fuck with almond milk
01:19:44 well i've had it it's a little lighter
01:19:46 than whole milk yeah not milk
01:19:47 it's not it's nonsense it's a chalkiness
01:19:50 well it's some fucking shit where you
01:19:51 you
01:19:52 take almonds and then you soak them
01:19:55 and then you get this murky water and
01:19:57 then you drink that and lie to yourself
01:19:58 and by the way most almond milk has
01:20:00 sugar in it like duncan
01:20:02 i love dunking and dad like dude almond
01:20:04 milk it's so healthy i go yeah
01:20:05 why don't you read how much sugar it is
01:20:07 per serving he's like 19
01:20:08 grams i go yeah 19 grams that's why it
01:20:11 tastes so good everybody lies you're
01:20:12 drinking a vanilla milkshake
01:20:14 well you go whitney's you go over
01:20:15 whitney's house when he has all these
01:20:16 weird plant-based things
01:20:18 but they're all kind of like weird like
01:20:20 plant-based chocolate pops and
01:20:22 chocolate almond milk and but she's very
01:20:24 thin because she she doesn't eat a lot
01:20:26 of those up a lot she well that's what
01:20:27 she does she has speed
01:20:29 yeah it's a good point she did all of
01:20:30 those things all of those things help

01:20:40 reactions
01:20:41 um but yeah i mean but the plant-based
01:20:44 stuff never feels that healthy is she on
01:20:46 plant-based diets is that what she's
01:20:47 doing no she'll have meat every now and
01:20:48 then like i'll bring her food that has
01:20:50 meat in it and she probably eats like a
01:20:52 wolf
01:20:52 yeah she'll eat it i mean a lot of times
01:20:54 i try to bring her like an eggplant
01:20:55 parmesan or something that's like in her

01:22:29 are
01:22:29 yeah that was wearing on me so i said

01:23:51 capital of the world
01:23:52 food is fucking sensational very good
01:23:54 the people are cool as shit
01:23:55 i just felt like that's a good spot 100
01:23:58 i mean we all need comment i'm doing a
01:24:00 tent in long island in two weeks at
01:24:01 governor's day
01:24:03 they've set up a tent in the parking lot
01:24:05 and i'm doing it because one
01:24:06 cause like hey good for them why not
01:24:09 good for them
01:24:10 time to start little by little figuring
01:24:12 out like what this is gonna look like
01:24:14 good for them for just fucking adapting
01:24:16 you know i like that these restaurants
01:24:18 are like
01:24:19 if you go down venice they're like
01:24:20 taking up the sidewalk yeah they're like
01:24:22 we were all supposed to shoot i don't
01:24:24 want to say what but me and a bunch of
01:24:25 other people
01:24:26 were supposed to shoot something for
01:24:28 netflix uh in august in la that never
01:24:31 happened that's so now it's like you
01:24:32 don't know what the hell is going to
01:24:33 happen with that
01:24:34 yeah um i um i was going to
01:24:37 try to do my next special uh right
01:24:40 around the new year
01:24:41 that was my plan and you had the garden
01:24:43 book get all these things oh yeah
01:24:44 i had a lot of shit booked but my plan
01:24:46 was to
01:24:48 make this mad run i was going to do
01:24:49 boston gardening madison square garden i
01:24:52 had all these theaters booked me and
01:24:53 chappelle were doing a bunch of dates
01:24:55 and the thing was to come into like
01:24:56 january february just fucking coming in
01:24:59 hot
01:24:59 and do my next special and now it's like
01:25:02 part of me look i'm not happy that this
01:25:04 is happening for anybody that's sick or
01:25:06 anybody lost a business anybody but
01:25:08 you have to be able to adapt and look at
01:25:11 the bright side
01:25:12 so for me what i'm thinking is right now
01:25:15 is at the very least what i can do is
01:25:18 use this as an opportunity to examine
01:25:20 what i want to say in my act right
01:25:22 examine it instead of just doing bits
01:25:24 that i know are killing because i have a
01:25:25 lot of bits that i know are just
01:25:26 murdering
01:25:27 right and i'm like okay should i do that
01:25:28 bit how what is that is this how i feel
01:25:31 is this real like where where do i go
01:25:32 with this and then go
01:25:34 go forth once the year rolls over i
01:25:37 think around 20
01:25:38 21 january february that's
01:25:41 most likely if there's a possibility of
01:25:44 doing stand-up again
01:25:45 that's when it's going to open up
01:25:46 because they're talking about having
01:25:47 some sort of a vaccine
01:25:48 around december so well let's see but
01:25:51 yeah
01:25:52 yeah sure yeah i think it's gonna get to
01:25:55 a point we're gonna get to hurt immunity
01:25:56 a little quicker than we think
01:25:58 well you know i was talking to uh ron
01:26:00 funches yesterday and i was like ron
01:26:01 what if this is it
01:26:02 this is the this is how we live from now
01:26:04 on you could still go to the store
01:26:06 you could wear a mask right you could
01:26:07 still go to a restaurant wear a mask
01:26:09 like is this or what would we do right
01:26:11 would we eventually just start doing
01:26:13 stand-up again say fuck it if you catch
01:26:14 it you catch it
01:26:16 it's a good question i don't know i i
01:26:18 think that
01:26:19 you can reach her immunity with this at
01:26:21 a lower percentage than a lot of other
01:26:23 things because we
01:26:24 they say that we have exposure to prior
01:26:26 previous corona viruses and that
01:26:28 you could maybe start reaching some
01:26:29 level herd of meaning around 20 to 30
01:26:31 percent as opposed to 60 percent
01:26:33 which would mean that new york already i
01:26:34 mean the new york kova cases are very
01:26:36 low
01:26:37 that's one of the reasons i'm doing that
01:26:38 tent is because they're very low right
01:26:40 now
01:26:41 yeah but la's skyrocketing la's
01:26:43 skyrocketing but no one cares
01:26:44 like everybody's out there is
01:26:46 skyrocketing it's the wrath of a
01:26:47 vengeful gods
01:26:52 i mean let's be very honest i mean do we
01:26:55 deserve to not
01:26:56 be no i i think it's skyrocketing
01:26:58 because it just went across country
01:27:00 it was just east to west everything cool
01:27:02 kind of starts in new york then it ends
01:27:04 up in la to get sold and get ruined and
01:27:06 get big and get ruined
01:27:08 so covet started in new york you know
01:27:10 it's one here just gives you zits
01:27:14 around everybody just uses covent
01:27:16 filters to block yours no one cares i
01:27:18 mean people are out in the outdoor
01:27:19 restaurants i mean it doesn't really
01:27:20 matter people are enjoying the
01:27:21 restaurants the outdoor restaurants but
01:27:23 i feel so bad for all the really good
01:27:24 restaurants that don't have an outlet
01:27:27 places like that i'm really i'm upset
01:27:28 nancy silverton's ppl
01:27:30 apl felix you like felix has an outsider
01:27:34 oh they do
01:27:34 oh that's wonderful they're whole
01:27:36 outside it's fantastic that's awesome
01:27:37 maybe i'll go there tonight they have a
01:27:39 next door restaurant that had this whole
01:27:40 outside area that you knocked out over
01:27:42 there
01:27:42 in the desert when you go to restaurant
01:27:44 it does you eat the food you like
01:27:45 chewing it you're like what the fuck is
01:27:46 this
01:27:48 what kind of food today i don't know
01:27:49 what goes on i go to like seafood
01:27:51 restaurants after i start chewing
01:27:52 something i'm like i don't even know
01:27:53 what this is
01:27:54 i've no i there's one good one called
01:27:56 pacifica which is really good
01:27:58 but there's a lot of restaurants out
01:27:59 there in the desert where we go
01:28:00 something's wrong
01:28:01 so you just decided to go out there did
01:28:03 you previously have experience with tom
01:28:05 no but i was in a car and then the
01:28:07 people the riots started
01:28:09 so i i was in a car and the riot started
01:28:13 and i literally
01:28:14 instead of going back to my house
01:28:15 because i live right off sunset an
01:28:16 apartment right off sunset
01:28:17 instead of going back i just got on the
01:28:19 10 east that's right
01:28:21 never even been out there i just said i
01:28:22 put the clothes on my back
01:28:24 i said not swear to god instead of
01:28:26 getting under 10 east what am i gonna go
01:28:28 i look like a cop i look like a guy that
01:28:30 should be burned alive
01:28:31 for every sin that this country has
01:28:34 committed right right
01:28:35 no one would care my own parents would
01:28:36 be like he probably did something right
01:28:39 to deserve that
01:28:40 so i'm like i'm getting the fuck out of
01:28:41 here because i get lit up immediately
01:28:44 um so i just started driving under 10
01:28:46 east i got an airbnb i took some dude

01:29:33 east coast guy east coast is where i was
01:29:35 born and raised like

01:29:37 palm desert yeah because it should well
01:29:39 what are you going to do i'm not i can't
01:29:40 go
01:29:40 move back to new york get shot in the
01:29:42 face so i'm staying there until december
01:29:45 till the holidays and then i'll figure
01:29:46 out you know who knows we'll see what's
01:29:48 happening in the world
01:29:48 the violence rate in new york right now
01:29:50 awesome it's a little too much
01:29:52 it's a little too much so crazy it's a
01:29:54 lot and um listen how are they gonna
01:29:56 turn that back
01:29:57 it'll be turn around dude in five years
01:29:59 everything it's a cycle it'll it'll
01:30:00 bottom out a little bit
01:30:01 or or be done forever because bosnia
01:30:04 it'll be a cycle dude in five years a
01:30:06 bunch of rich kids will move in there
01:30:07 just like they moved in there in 2009
01:30:09 they'll start doing alternative comedy
01:30:11 dressing like fucking
01:30:12 you know fucking like flappers they'll
01:30:15 start tripping you know
01:30:16 and they'll just and that'll be the
01:30:18 resurgence of the city they'll they'll
01:30:20 they'll open a bunch of new coffee
01:30:22 houses in what used to be homeless
01:30:23 shelters
01:30:24 and it'll just and it's just a cycle but
01:30:27 what needs to happen now there's going
01:30:28 to be a lot of pain
01:30:29 yeah there's going to be a lot of
01:30:30 displacement of people and then i think
01:30:32 this could be the route to the city
01:30:34 getting cool again
01:30:35 to maybe younger artistic people coming
01:30:37 in architects doing cool shit
01:30:40 reimagining public spaces you know new
01:30:42 york needs to get shaken out of its tree
01:30:44 a little bit and so does la that's
01:30:45 what's happening
01:30:45 right i just don't want to be here for
01:30:47 it like maybe it'll get dirty and
01:30:49 dangerous again
01:30:50 it's going to get to the point where
01:30:51 maybe everything won't suck times square
01:30:53 will be like time square
01:30:54 yeah and people that move to new york
01:30:56 will will they'll be
01:30:58 you know listen if you know you could
01:31:00 get slashed on the way to the comedy

01:32:00 you take you just sit down was it an
01:32:03 arsenal thing or was it because he was
01:32:05 he was stealing things from the mall no
01:32:07 i think he was just walking around the
01:32:08 mall being
01:32:09 being what he does which is with a
01:32:11 camera and then i think
01:32:12 you know he left i think an ak-47 on his
01:32:14 hot tub like
01:32:16 leaned up against the hot tub i think
01:32:17 somebody ratted him out and then you
01:32:18 know did you show it on twitter or
01:32:20 something
01:32:20 yeah there was something on instagram or
01:32:22 something but dude

01:32:41 they're going to have arsenal's good
01:32:42 point yeah man why not
01:32:44 it's not a bad idea yeah but i don't
01:32:46 know like la's very weird because you're
01:32:49 you're like where do i fit in you know
01:32:50 without stand-up comedy or like i
01:32:52 podcast and that's
01:32:53 good and i try to make that as funny as
01:32:54 i can but then you look around a lot of
01:32:56 places l.a like i don't really fit in
01:32:58 with the actors
01:32:59 and i'm not really one of these kids
01:33:00 it's really like a social media guy
01:33:02 and then i'm not one of these com these
01:33:04 writers that you know tweet about global
01:33:06 warming and black lives matter all day
01:33:07 so you look you're like my community of
01:33:09 people which was the store
01:33:11 and the stand-up comedians are have now
01:33:13 been like dispersed
01:33:14 so it's like a weird like i'm like a man
01:33:16 without a country yeah i feel like that
01:33:18 too and i want to be adopted by one of
01:33:20 these like someone come
01:33:22 in here like one of these big youtubers
01:33:23 i don't care
01:33:25 anybody one of these guys that walk
01:33:27 around you know like high pistes and
01:33:29 these crazy shirts and everything just
01:33:31 i'll be one of those guys just
01:33:33 someone knocked on my door your own
01:33:34 thing well i mean
01:33:36 golf shirts and just screaming just just
01:33:38 polos just like this just ill-fitting
01:33:40 polos yeah
01:33:41 ill-fitting polos for the american
01:33:42 racist
01:33:45 polos are a weird choice pier like why
01:33:47 is it that that is like
01:33:48 the only thing i wear for dorks wear you
01:33:50 know what it is i i
01:33:52 i've always wanted to look like i've had
01:33:54 money and i've never
01:33:55 looked like it and there's a type of guy
01:33:58 that's from
01:33:59 a lot of them live in new york or long
01:34:00 island or boston by the way yes izod
01:34:02 yes and they wear these fucking polos
01:34:04 and they have no fucking money and
01:34:05 that's the kind of guy that i am where
01:34:06 it's like
01:34:07 i always want to look but they're always
01:34:09 sunburned
01:34:10 and they've always got like an
01:34:11 ill-fitting thing like the collards like
01:34:12 these collars all fucked up
01:34:14 because i tumble dry it in the wash like
01:34:15 an animal
01:34:18 i look like a like a golf pro who's
01:34:20 failed at everything
01:34:21 his wife laughed like john daly's
01:34:23 brother yeah yeah i mean
01:34:25 but that's the look and when you have
01:34:26 the look you just honor the look the
01:34:28 izod
01:34:28 look i remember when i was a kid i have
01:34:30 fake eyes ons we couldn't afford
01:34:32 uh alligator okay so what was it you
01:34:34 have like an armadillo a bullshit thing
01:34:36 that you buy from like
01:34:37 you know some stupid departments yeah
01:34:39 and guys would glue
01:34:41 uh an alligator over it oh really
01:34:44 depressing
01:34:45 oh that's rough yeah well they would
01:34:47 fake it they made it out
01:34:48 but
01:34:51 but it's so funny like you figured it
01:34:53 out kids labels to kids are a big deal
01:34:55 like if you have off-brand sneakers on
01:34:57 like
01:34:57 one summer saved up for a versace shirt
01:35:00 and i bought this versace shirt it was
01:35:02 like this weird mesh material that
01:35:04 clings to your body
01:35:04 now here's now we can imagine there were
01:35:06 many problems with that right
01:35:08 because versace has european cut clothes
01:35:11 now even if i
01:35:12 you know were a small clothes cock
01:35:13 clothes no cut cut they're european
01:35:16 they're for dudes with like small
01:35:17 shoulders you know the you see dolce
01:35:19 gabbana like
01:35:20 they're just they're they're they're
01:35:21 women like they're hangers right
01:35:23 so i bought this versace shirt which was
01:35:25 like blue and mash and it was just a
01:35:27 night i mean
01:35:28 i look like grover or something like
01:35:30 cookie monster walking around
01:35:31 and then i just spilled something on it
01:35:33 and then i realized like designer
01:35:34 clothes you can't ever spill anything on
01:35:37 and ever
01:35:37 or you have to like throw it out like
01:35:39 those types of material
01:35:40 it just doesn't work and i'm like oh the
01:35:42 people that wear these don't eat
01:35:44 or when they eat they don't eat in a way
01:35:46 that gets things on them
01:35:47 or when they get things dirty they just
01:35:49 throw them throw them out get another
01:35:50 one they're crazy yeah they're wild
01:35:51 i've never been into fashion yeah i
01:35:53 never have either but i have been
01:35:55 fascinated by the whole
01:35:57 paris fashion show runway me too it's
01:36:00 interesting to the point where i've
01:36:01 actually like i remember when kanye west
01:36:02 was getting into that
01:36:03 and you know he was making his stuff and
01:36:05 have people wear it on runways right
01:36:07 i almost want to be there to see what
01:36:10 one of those things are like because i
01:36:11 bet
01:36:11 some of the people there are probably so
01:36:13 preposterous yes so weird well that's
01:36:15 like going out to dinner in l.a you see
01:36:17 these people walk into these restaurants
01:36:18 and it's kind of hilarious you're like
01:36:19 these people are
01:36:21 like a a meme i mean like they're not
01:36:24 even real
01:36:24 i'm like oh my god so that's what
01:36:26 fashion week is like i think i think
01:36:27 it's an entire business built on
01:36:28 bullshit
01:36:29 yeah it's like an entire business built
01:36:31 on like what do you think and like buzz
01:36:33 and all this crap like there's nothing
01:36:35 real about it other than
01:36:37 what's created as long as our business
01:36:39 is kind of like that too where it's like
01:36:41 there's no nuts and bolts and it's all
01:36:43 pretty much like
01:36:45 what set where's popular sentiment going
01:36:47 how much can we affect it how much can
01:36:48 we direct it
01:36:49 and then there's you know
01:36:50 eight-year-olds in pakistan that make
01:36:52 all the clothes
01:36:53 yes yes all these things
01:36:56 which is sad but they need to work
01:37:01 i mean we see what happens when you shut
01:37:02 down a country nobody works do we want
01:37:04 eight-year-old pakistan he's in antifa
01:37:05 no
01:37:06 work i wonder what's gonna happen with
01:37:08 uh american manufacturing i wonder if
01:37:10 there's gonna be a real shift
01:37:11 recognizing what a huge problem is
01:37:13 having all our medicine made in china
01:37:15 all like there's not a single phone
01:37:16 that's made here not a fucking phone
01:37:18 single one
01:37:18 not a single one everybody has a phone
01:37:20 there's millions i wonder if this makes
01:37:21 us rethink all of that and that we gotta
01:37:23 be more i mean that would make sense
01:37:25 right because ninety percent of our
01:37:26 antibiotics are made in china yeah most
01:37:28 of our medications that's crazy
01:37:30 that's one of the things that i thought
01:37:31 was very interesting about trump
01:37:33 was that he was like you know listen
01:37:34 he's fucking we're getting fucked by
01:37:35 china they're fucking us
01:37:36 he was right he was right but it's just
01:37:39 when he's
01:37:40 right about things those things become
01:37:42 wrong correct because people don't like
01:37:44 him that's what i'm saying about the
01:37:45 politicalization
01:37:46 whether that's word or not of
01:37:47 hydroxychloroquine yeah when shop got
01:37:50 the covid he took it the doctor asked
01:37:53 him what his political leanings are he's
01:37:55 like what
01:37:55 he's like a lot of people don't want to
01:37:57 take hydroxychloroquine because of trump
01:38:00 yeah and he's like is that what i should
01:38:01 take it was yesterday was getting
01:38:02 nervous you think it's like a history
01:38:03 test you're like
01:38:04 where do you stand on imperialism so i
01:38:06 was like wait what he was better off
01:38:07 just coughing he was like what are you
01:38:09 talking about yeah give me the fucking
01:38:10 medication that works
01:38:11 that's crazy yeah there's a doctor uh
01:38:14 what was that if any doctor says this
01:38:17 helps anybody that doesn't want to take
01:38:18 it
01:38:19 to me is crazy but it's a strange one in
01:38:21 that so many people are against it but
01:38:23 it's like
01:38:24 it's like hold on a second there's a uh
01:38:26 an article what's that article that i
01:38:28 pulled up
01:38:29 um really recently about oh here it is
01:38:32 the key to defeating uh covid19 already
01:38:35 exists we need to start using it
01:38:36 this is a doctor who is a
01:38:40 legitimate scientist right so then
01:38:43 they're trying to figure out like why is
01:38:45 this person
01:38:46 it works from doctor professor professor
01:38:49 of epidemiology from yale school
01:38:51 of uh public health he's not a he's not
01:38:54 full of shit he's not full of shit he's
01:38:55 saying listen there's
01:38:56 real evidence to show that particularly
01:38:58 in the early stages of this disease
01:39:00 before it stops the virus from spreading
01:39:02 it's an it's a malaria disease that's
01:39:03 been used forever but
01:39:04 a doctor in new york told me it was like
01:39:06 the lazarus drug like people just
01:39:08 getting up and walking out of the hot
01:39:09 like like people literally that came in
01:39:11 with it if they used it early enough it
01:39:12 was really
01:39:13 good right but then you hear these
01:39:15 studies where people are saying no
01:39:16 in fact more people died when they're on
01:39:18 it like well what the fuck is true what
01:39:20 is real
01:39:21 yeah i don't i mean that's when you just
01:39:23 have to kind of clock out and you go
01:39:24 let's
01:39:24 figure it out well is it because of is
01:39:27 it different stages of the disease where
01:39:29 it's not effective
01:39:30 is it different like is it old people it
01:39:32 doesn't work on but it works on young
01:39:33 people
01:39:34 what are the studies how are you doing
01:39:36 the studies who's doing the studies i
01:39:38 mean it's
01:39:38 it's all very difficult have you done
01:39:40 anything different
01:39:41 in terms of like taking care of yourself
01:39:43 i take vitamin d
01:39:45 how much i take vitamin d i think five
01:39:46 thousand i use a day that's right
01:39:48 i take vitamin d um yeah i started
01:39:50 starting
01:39:51 i started smoking because the cigarettes
01:39:53 they said help
01:39:55 oh there was an article i'm kidding i
01:39:57 didn't know what's happening every now
01:39:58 and then i have one one cigarette but i
01:39:59 don't smoke i don't smoke but
01:40:01 every now and then at night as a
01:40:04 as a it's a relaxing thing once in a
01:40:06 while not all the time
01:40:08 do you smoke cigars no i should you want
01:40:10 one right now
01:40:12 no okay really yeah i appreciate it
01:40:14 though i should install a whole box of
01:40:15 them mike binding
01:40:16 i know i don't need another habit very
01:40:18 good just start smoking cars i don't
01:40:19 have to smoke cigars all the time i know
01:40:22 i i have an addictive personality so
01:40:23 whatever i do i tend to do it a lot
01:40:25 guess what that's the problem that's the
01:40:27 problem that's why i got good at comedy
01:40:28 diaz talks about it like
01:40:30 got addicted to that you know that's the
01:40:32 whole thing is like you end up getting
01:40:34 addicted to
01:40:36 something so you better make sure that
01:40:38 it's something good but i i've been
01:40:39 trying to do
01:40:40 better things and you know swimming a
01:40:42 lot working you know working out things
01:40:44 like that
01:40:44 well have you ever talked like when uh
01:40:47 evolutionary biologists talk about
01:40:48 addictive personalities and obsessive
01:40:50 personalities obsessive behavior and
01:40:52 they say that you're actually
01:40:54 this is very controversial but they
01:40:55 think some of them think that you're
01:40:56 actually
01:40:57 tapping into a trait that would make you
01:40:59 get very successful at things like
01:41:01 hunting
01:41:02 for survival like you get obsessed at
01:41:04 something so you you want to perfect it
01:41:06 you want to be
01:41:06 you're obsessed by it so you become
01:41:08 better at it so you become more
01:41:09 successful so you survive
01:41:10 because you have food interesting yeah
01:41:12 which makes sense or sure
01:41:14 or combat or the things where you're
01:41:15 going to be able to figure out so that's
01:41:17 like a primary
01:41:18 trait that a lot of us have and he gets
01:41:20 hijacked by heroin
01:41:21 right he gets hijacked by gambling it's
01:41:24 hijacked by something horrible it gets
01:41:26 hijacked by jerking off
01:41:27 yeah wow that's what it is wow so you
01:41:29 would have been a hunter
01:41:31 mm-hmm yeah oh it's listen it makes 100
01:41:33 it does
01:41:34 it does i mean it's just it's crazy it's
01:41:36 like in the modern
01:41:37 world that that trait becomes sometimes
01:41:40 a liability well this in the modern
01:41:42 world there's so many
01:41:43 like the modern world is not natural
01:41:45 every fucking thing that we do
01:41:46 is very recent everything this is
01:41:49 they're so unnatural like every the way
01:41:50 we said
01:41:51 yeah yeah well what we do for a living
01:41:54 has only been around for 100
01:41:55 not even 100 years right when there was
01:41:57 the first stand-up
01:41:58 i think it was the mafia started putting
01:42:00 putting these nightclubs together after
01:42:02 like vaudeville
01:42:03 like it was started those type of acts
01:42:04 they started putting a brick wall up
01:42:06 yeah but i think that was you know that
01:42:07 was it's all very recent it's
01:42:09 it's in the last century yeah in the
01:42:11 last 90 and
01:42:12 guys like us would have been the mc
01:42:14 right and it would have been like a
01:42:16 fucking
01:42:16 go-go dancer and a guy playing drums yes
01:42:19 yeah that's all that shit we're
01:42:21 descendants of like uh you know
01:42:23 tent carnivals and circuses it is crazy
01:42:26 that one of the most
01:42:27 prominent art forms in the world which
01:42:29 is stand-up comedy
01:42:31 is literally within the last 100 years
01:42:34 yeah but a lot of
01:42:35 it you know yeah but like that's your
01:42:36 music
01:42:38 poetry you have to look at the
01:42:39 predecessor's tuesday like it was
01:42:41 probably in the middle ages it was a
01:42:42 court jester
01:42:44 right so there's always been somebody
01:42:45 goofing around and being funny
01:42:47 sometimes they did comedic plays
01:42:49 sometimes there there had to be a guy
01:42:51 in the town square yeah yelling at
01:42:53 storytellers
01:42:54 and podcasting is like we're essentially
01:42:57 it's it's like other than being a whore
01:42:59 or a hooker
01:43:00 it's like the oldest profession because
01:43:01 we're just talking sort of
01:43:03 but we're doing it in a new way where
01:43:05 people are doing other things and
01:43:06 they're getting entertained while
01:43:07 they're doing other things like right
01:43:08 now while you and i are yucking it up
01:43:09 yeah there's a guy who's running around
01:43:11 a lake
01:43:11 right and he's out there laughing his
01:43:13 ass off sweating and it distracts him
01:43:15 he looks down in his watch yeah yeah
01:43:18 yeah
01:43:19 it's true yeah yeah but it's just it's
01:43:21 so simple it's like we're just
01:43:22 recording things changed a lot of that
01:43:23 because like musicians changed too
01:43:25 because everything would have had been a
01:43:26 hundred percent live performance like
01:43:28 sure
01:43:29 if you play guitar or a harp or what
01:43:31 file or whatever the fuck it would have
01:43:32 been well that's what i missed
01:43:33 i miss i love podcasting and i get to do
01:43:36 it and i
01:43:37 but i i do miss the live oh yeah
01:43:40 experience being in a
01:43:41 because everything has context live yeah
01:43:44 twitter all these things have no context
01:43:45 when i did the uh houston improv which
01:43:47 is the only date that i did over the
01:43:48 last uh
01:43:49 few months it was like i felt like i was
01:43:51 getting away with something
01:43:52 i was like right and then i realized i
01:43:54 kind of have like almost like a low-key
01:43:56 depression
01:43:57 right i'm not doing stand-up it's not
01:43:59 bad it's not but it's like
01:44:00 right this is what it is and this is i i
01:44:03 hate to tell you all you folks out there
01:44:05 regular people who do not kill if you do
01:44:08 not go on stage and kill you do not know
01:44:10 what that feels like it's a high it is
01:44:12 not just a high yeah it is one of the
01:44:13 biggest highs in all shows
01:44:15 it's a life affirmation when you and i
01:44:16 would do the main room at the fucking
01:44:18 store and you get off stage and murder
01:44:20 it's great
01:44:20 and like you would hand it off to me and
01:44:22 nothing's better oh my god nothing's
01:44:24 better
01:44:25 it's like the feeling and there's a
01:44:26 feeling that i remember like going on
01:44:28 stage like when someone was coming off
01:44:29 like they would introduce you and they
01:44:31 would just crush
01:44:32 and you looked at their face and you got
01:44:33 to see like there's a face of a person
01:44:35 who just
01:44:36 crushed right like they just and i would
01:44:39 i would always say this like i feel bad
01:44:40 for people who don't know what it's like
01:44:41 to crush
01:44:42 yeah well it's also like you look at
01:44:45 actors and you know how fun could that
01:44:47 be
01:44:47 it's fun i'm sure it is but it's it
01:44:50 can't be anywhere near as fun
01:44:51 no can't be anyone you're as fun just in
01:44:53 the raw visceral reaction of people like
01:44:56 greg geraldo always used to say
01:44:57 like it's that visceral you know
01:45:00 feeling it's not so much it's not like
01:45:02 you're getting love
01:45:04 but it's like you're just this it's like
01:45:06 this weird almost
01:45:08 like god-like experience you're having
01:45:10 in terms of like
01:45:12 being able to take a room full of 300
01:45:14 people and bring them
01:45:15 with you on a journey yes and take them
01:45:18 from where they are
01:45:18 to a place where they're hysterically
01:45:20 laughing to chan it's like a chemical
01:45:22 reaction to change
01:45:24 people's i mean that's why i'm going to
01:45:26 go do it in a tent
01:45:27 you're giving him a drug yes like yeah
01:45:28 you're giving him a drug yeah and i'm
01:45:30 not gonna do a lot of those shows but i
01:45:31 said i'll do one let me see what it's
01:45:33 like i'm curious
01:45:35 as to what it's like and i i've shit on
01:45:37 them and
01:45:38 i and i and i still may after i do it
01:45:40 but like i want to see what it's like
01:45:42 to just do it in in in in the
01:45:45 circumstances it can be done right now
01:45:47 are you going to do one with bert those
01:45:48 driving things you were talking about
01:45:49 that i'm not
01:45:50 going to do i love him
01:45:54 but i'm not going to do i don't want to
01:45:55 entertain cars like you you sip people
01:45:57 in a parking lot i'm cool
01:45:59 when i start performing at dodge
01:46:01 durango's and listen god bless him
01:46:03 he's got a huge fan base a lot of people
01:46:05 doing it i think kafka did it
01:46:06 i just personally don't i feel like
01:46:09 that's way too
01:46:10 disconnected for me this is all personal
01:46:13 right
01:46:14 yeah everybody's going to figure like i
01:46:15 love podcasting i i try to be as funny
01:46:17 as i can he's crazy rants
01:46:19 and that gets a little bit out that i
01:46:21 need to get out yeah
01:46:22 i i would rather do that than perform in
01:46:24 front of cars yeah
01:46:26 i don't know man i i think i'm going to
01:46:28 maybe i'm going to think once i'll try
01:46:29 the car thing you got to try it all once
01:46:31 but bert's doing it all over the country
01:46:33 he's basically on a drive-through what i
01:46:34 love about burp was like they were like
01:46:36 we're shutting down comedies like no
01:46:37 we're not
01:46:39 yeah burt's like we're not yeah he just
01:46:41 got shoveled out there
01:46:42 but it's also it's you know that the
01:46:45 thing about covid
01:46:46 it does give you an opportunity if
01:46:48 you're a comic to sort of sit down and
01:46:50 rethink things
01:46:51 and also to really appreciate what it's
01:46:53 like
01:46:54 to do stand-up again yeah that's true
01:46:56 like when we did that weekend in houston
01:46:57 like
01:46:58 i did it with uh moses and uh
01:47:00 hinchcliffe and uh
01:47:01 when we came back we were like man i
01:47:03 missed that yeah my god that was fun
01:47:06 yeah i mean i know that i'm walking into
01:47:07 a situation where i might i might get
01:47:09 off stage and go oh fuck this forever
01:47:11 because it's a rough you know it's going
01:47:13 to be different it's not going to be
01:47:15 thankful though but i'm going to be
01:47:16 thankful
01:47:16 we're going to have a lot of fun tickets
01:47:19 sold immediately and like
01:47:20 that we're putting more shows on and
01:47:21 then it's my home i from long island
01:47:24 right so i'm gonna have a lot of fun
01:47:25 there with the people that come out
01:47:28 and where i think because it's gonna be
01:47:30 a really great place to ease back in
01:47:32 because i'm gonna be able to do some
01:47:33 material go off the top my head
01:47:36 know that the crowd has a lot of shared
01:47:37 experiences with me because we all grew
01:47:39 up in the same place
01:47:40 it's kind of uh training wheels to to
01:47:43 kind of come back in and then hopefully
01:47:45 i'm hoping by this winter we're kind of
01:47:49 start revving up again
01:47:52 because we can't i mean what are we
01:47:54 gonna do well what do we do if
01:47:56 covid is like this next august
01:47:59 if we're all the way to next august and
01:48:00 still like this i think it's on the road
01:48:02 again
01:48:03 i think it is a certain time we're gonna
01:48:05 have to make that distinction because
01:48:07 like
01:48:08 at the end of the day how does the
01:48:09 economy survive how does the country
01:48:11 survive
01:48:13 without these things i mean sports is a
01:48:15 mental people need
01:48:16 sports they need to participate like
01:48:20 they need to watch sport like you can't
01:48:22 take all of this away
01:48:23 forever i mean there's all these freaks
01:48:26 listen i get the people that the masks
01:48:27 that are like coughing in elderly
01:48:29 people's faces no good
01:48:31 but on the other side you have these
01:48:33 people that are like these weird like
01:48:35 cat moms that are like wine drunk baking
01:48:38 bread on instagram it's like
01:48:40 honey we can't do this for 10 years
01:48:43 i know you're happy because you're this
01:48:44 weird freak that doesn't like leaving
01:48:46 anyway
01:48:47 people need to fucking leave their homes
01:48:49 yeah they need to leave their homes and
01:48:50 there's not a lot of entertainment
01:48:51 coming down the pipe either
01:48:53 not a lot of movies being made no not a
01:48:55 lot of ways to entertain yourself and
01:48:57 these studios are trying to figure out
01:48:58 ways to film
01:49:00 these movies and and keep people safe
01:49:02 but it's hard man yeah
01:49:03 they're gonna quarantine everybody and
01:49:05 put in hotels and
01:49:07 it's difficult yeah and but that's why i
01:49:10 think eventually
01:49:11 you know new york uh covert rates are
01:49:13 very low i think that it's going to blow
01:49:16 through
01:49:16 i think there might be a little second
01:49:18 wave but i think eventually
01:49:20 the viruses weaken they weaken and they
01:49:22 disappear it happened in 1918 with the
01:49:24 spanish flu
01:49:25 they weaken and this will weaken yeah
01:49:28 why does the virus weaken
01:49:29 well you know it just i'm an
01:49:31 epidemiologist
01:49:32 and what you see is a lot of times the
01:49:35 virus
01:49:36 is just it goes into the hosts and then
01:49:38 eventually the virus is like ah
01:49:40 like what causes it is it the people
01:49:42 that just runs through it's just like a
01:49:44 picture
01:49:44 somebody that just fucks everybody that
01:49:46 you they've just ran through
01:49:48 they moved to the next town right you
01:49:51 just fuck
01:49:52 everybody and then you're like what am i
01:49:53 gonna do and then if you fuck like 30
01:49:55 people by the time you fuck the thirty
01:49:56 first place
01:49:56 you barely have a heart attack dust yeah
01:49:59 you gotta have a hard one so i think
01:50:00 this this fire's just
01:50:01 i mean i don't know i don't know exactly
01:50:03 how it happens but it does historically
01:50:04 happen it's happened
01:50:06 yeah historically i mean do you think
01:50:08 this is a different kind of disease
01:50:09 though
01:50:10 i think the big problem is the bigger
01:50:12 issue actually now is
01:50:13 is economic even though cove is a
01:50:14 massive issue i think the bigger issue
01:50:16 is
01:50:17 how are we gonna how are we gonna stop
01:50:18 28 million people from being evicted or
01:50:21 foreclosed on because they couldn't go
01:50:22 to jobs
01:50:23 the government literally shut down the
01:50:24 economy these people could not work so
01:50:26 through no fault of their own
01:50:27 they have a real problem here there's a
01:50:29 real like housing issue
01:50:30 not just that how about the businesses
01:50:32 that are closed down how do you restart
01:50:33 a business when you have no money
01:50:34 correct what do you do how do you get
01:50:36 going and does the government have money
01:50:37 to give these people loans
01:50:38 you know now get started again i mean i
01:50:40 think they have to do something whether
01:50:41 it's universal basic income i don't know
01:50:43 what they're going to do
01:50:44 but that economic issue is going to be
01:50:46 really really massive
01:50:49 it's so fucking anxiety filled it is
01:50:52 it's like how does this end it's a great
01:50:56 movie in texas
01:50:58 that's where it ends it just ends in
01:50:59 taxes that we all have guns that we all
01:51:00 just sit on our porches all day waiting
01:51:02 for someone to come near us how often
01:51:03 have you shot a gun
01:51:05 a few times like all upstate new york i
01:51:08 should i mean i don't have a guy i
01:51:09 should get a guy i didn't think i'd need
01:51:10 a gun when i moved to l.a i didn't think
01:51:11 i'd have to sit by my i sit on my
01:51:13 balcony with a gun you know it seemed
01:51:16 relatively safe when i moved in people
01:51:18 were annoying but i didn't think they
01:51:19 were coming to kill me
01:51:20 i didn't think they were coming in my
01:51:20 windows to kill me but now that i've
01:51:23 now that i'm like yeah i should get a
01:51:24 gun yeah i think i texted you second
01:51:26 week of quarantine i'm like
01:51:27 i got a gun you're like yeah you're one
01:51:28 of them yeah you're one of my liberal
01:51:30 friends
01:51:30 i'm not a liberal friend but i was like
01:51:33 are you a centrist
01:51:34 i think i believe in pedophile cults and
01:51:36 lizard people i think that's centrist
01:51:38 i think that's in the center i'm on the
01:51:41 fence with lizard people but the
01:51:42 pedophile cults are real
01:51:43 they're all real i just don't care i
01:51:46 don't care
01:51:46 that's really my political option it's
01:51:48 like i i think
01:51:50 it's not most of it isn't real you're
01:51:53 making a lot of it real it's not
01:51:55 real walk away like it truly
01:51:59 yeah like the the like people that are
01:52:02 real activists
01:52:04 a lot of them have like a degree like
01:52:06 they're a lawyer or a doctor and then
01:52:07 they use
01:52:08 their skills to actually help people
01:52:11 right
01:52:11 and they give up really profitable
01:52:13 careers to do that shit right but dude
01:52:15 your twitter
01:52:16 fucking posturing and your virtue
01:52:17 signaling it doesn't do anything
01:52:19 it's fake i know it's fake and there's
01:52:21 just more to life than red and blue
01:52:23 and republican or democrat and all these
01:52:25 motherfuckers are trying to kill you and
01:52:26 they're all fucking losers
01:52:28 and they're all just i mean listen
01:52:30 they're more capable
01:52:32 like the all the shit that they've
01:52:33 pulled the cia all these people they're
01:52:35 just too good
01:52:36 they're good they've beat me they're
01:52:38 gonna win they're gonna win the cia is
01:52:40 gonna beat you
01:52:41 maybe you should join i don't know who
01:52:43 needs to hear i'd love to but i don't
01:52:44 know who needs to hear this
01:52:45 but like stop investing your emotional
01:52:48 all your emotions in your
01:52:49 your time and energy into this thing
01:52:51 like you would be so much better off if
01:52:53 you just found something you enjoyed and
01:52:55 did it
01:52:56 right but you don't want them taking
01:52:58 away your rights
01:52:59 and closing in on your email account
01:53:02 they're gonna do it anyway are they sure
01:53:06 don't take my rights send fucking matter
01:53:10 they're gonna take them buy the gun do
01:53:12 whatever you got to do like
01:53:14 there there's no winning here do you
01:53:16 believe in a well-armed militia you
01:53:17 think that's necessary
01:53:19 yeah but look i mean you could yeah i'm
01:53:21 all for people having guns
01:53:23 but a militia like it seems like more
01:53:26 now than ever
01:53:27 the idea of forming a militia is in
01:53:29 people it's gonna happen it'll happen
01:53:31 there'll be skirmishes there'll be
01:53:32 violence in the street but it's like
01:53:33 that's what i was most worried about
01:53:35 with portland and seattle
01:53:36 yeah at the end of the day you know i
01:53:39 mean i don't know
01:53:40 you know this country's not designed for
01:53:42 massive reimagining that's sad to say
01:53:44 i can say it i'm a comedian it is what
01:53:45 it is but the reality is
01:53:47 it's just not it's going to disintegrate
01:53:49 like everything else that's ever fucking
01:53:51 existed
01:53:52 on the planet and you just hope that it
01:53:54 the plane lands
01:53:55 slowly and doesn't nose dive into the
01:53:57 ground but the the best days are over
01:53:59 here
01:54:00 the bright like the the hopeful you know
01:54:03 we're going to the moon that's
01:54:04 that's done really you you don't think
01:54:07 so
01:54:08 i think we could be in a little bit of a
01:54:09 blip when we make a nice resurgence and
01:54:11 in a year and a half from now
01:54:12 everything's looking good i don't know i
01:54:14 think we just head into a dystopian
01:54:16 insane kind of like tech world where we
01:54:18 just all live on compute like reality
01:54:20 barely exists no it's a real problem
01:54:22 it's a dystopian world we're heading
01:54:24 into well the real problem is if
01:54:25 everything goes into like a ready player
01:54:27 one type situation where
01:54:29 whatever they can manufacture on a
01:54:31 computer with artificial reality is more
01:54:33 interesting
01:54:35 that's going to happen and listen most p
01:54:37 here's the problem most people
01:54:39 don't care they don't want these rights
01:54:41 they actually don't
01:54:42 you like them because you're like a
01:54:44 successful person most people don't give
01:54:46 a shit about their rights
01:54:47 they want pizza they want chicken wings
01:54:50 they want fucking soda
01:54:52 they want cheap credit they want to go
01:54:53 on a cruise once a year
01:54:55 they don't give a shit about their
01:54:56 rights they don't care they want netflix
01:54:59 and they want you know
01:55:00 garlic knots and that's the that's what
01:55:03 it is and
01:55:04 you could pretend like america's just
01:55:06 not a country like freedom loving
01:55:08 there's a few of those people most
01:55:10 people are just like hey whatever and
01:55:11 they're the happiest people a lot of
01:55:13 those people i'm talking about
01:55:15 are actually the happier people they're
01:55:17 not trying to build an empire
01:55:18 they're not trying to succeed they just
01:55:20 enjoy like putting something warm and
01:55:22 doughy in their mouth
01:55:23 vegging out and fucking waking up the
01:55:25 next day and go shit i'm here again
01:55:27 and and they're the happiest people they
01:55:29 like to get drunk and go boating that's
01:55:30 it they like to get fucked up and go out
01:55:32 on the lake
01:55:34 go out on the lake and get railed up and
01:55:36 yeah
01:55:37 and it's fun what are you gonna sit
01:55:38 around all day worry about what darpa's
01:55:40 doing it's like
01:55:42 the fuck kind of life is that
01:55:45 a burger it's over i mean enjoy it it's
01:55:48 the end
01:55:48 the end's not that bad as ends go
01:55:52 as things as ends go this end happens to
01:55:56 be hilarious and there's still food in
01:55:57 the food stores
01:55:59 yeah that's a good point as of right now
01:56:01 i like your optimism this is a good
01:56:03 end it's not a bad end it's not the
01:56:05 worst end
01:56:06 i want to see what happens when joe
01:56:08 biden gets into office
01:56:10 i want to sleep a lot he'll nap i don't
01:56:12 see what the speeches are like when he
01:56:14 forgets what he's talking about he's
01:56:15 gonna have no clue
01:56:16 kamala he'll run for return live for
01:56:19 he'll he'll
01:56:19 he'll live for a term he'll it's kamala
01:56:22 and if you
01:56:22 pronounce it wrong you're racist i call
01:56:24 her k-dog
01:56:26 no she she's gonna run he'll he'll do
01:56:28 one term and then she'll run i don't
01:56:30 think he'll run for a second term
01:56:31 he's already too old he'll he'll do one
01:56:34 term she'll come in again
01:56:35 no one will care about politics she'll
01:56:37 be yass queening all over the place if
01:56:38 he does
01:56:39 run for a second term he'll be in his
01:56:41 80s yeah he's not going to run for a
01:56:43 second term she'll
01:56:44 she'll run she knows that that's what
01:56:45 she's pumped but do you think they have
01:56:46 to think that through when they
01:56:48 when they run for president like if
01:56:50 you're 78 and you're barely hanging on
01:56:52 now
01:56:52 it's probably unspoken but i think that
01:56:54 that's probably i think why he picked
01:56:56 her
01:56:56 is because she's everybody's been vital
01:56:59 yeah she everybody's kind of comfortable
01:57:00 with her she's a centrist
01:57:02 she's a cop right she doesn't care
01:57:04 she'll put you right in jail
01:57:05 she'll put the cuffs on you the
01:57:06 government the larger power centers are
01:57:08 very happy with her
01:57:10 that she'll throw him in the vans she'll
01:57:12 brand ya thank you so much
01:57:13 she runs who's her vp god only knows i
01:57:16 mean someone else that shares her values
01:57:17 which are
01:57:18 here it is aesthetic political and a lot
01:57:20 of people requiring all americans to
01:57:22 wear masks
01:57:23 three months he says for three months he
01:57:25 was joined at briefing by his newly
01:57:27 named running mate
01:57:28 hmm let me hear it it's weird it's a
01:57:31 long
01:57:31 speech it says this i want to hear some
01:57:33 of it i just want to hear his voice
01:57:34 okay here it goes give me some when one
01:57:38 arrives
01:57:39 and what plans to be made for we talked
01:57:41 about significantly about the racial
01:57:42 disparities that exist
01:57:44 and how it is uh covert
01:57:47 19 is affecting the different races
01:57:51 differently
01:57:52 and uh we talked about the continued
01:57:54 lack of
01:57:55 uh ppe protective equipment and uh
01:57:59 testing capacity and the like but uh
01:58:03 and i've put out a comprehensive plan
01:58:05 over the last
01:58:06 three months on each of these things but
01:58:08 today
01:58:09 i want to talk about one thing very
01:58:12 straightforward
01:58:14 doesn't have anything to do with
01:58:15 democrats republicans or independents
01:58:18 it has to do with a single simple
01:58:21 proposition
01:58:22 every single american should
01:58:25 be wearing a mask when they're outside
01:58:29 what for the next three months at a
01:58:32 minimum
01:58:33 every governor should mandate
01:58:36 every governor should mandate mandatory
01:58:40 mask wearing the estimates by the
01:58:42 experts are will save
01:58:44 over 40 000 lives
01:58:48 in the next three months 40 000 lives
01:58:52 that people act responsibly and uh
01:58:55 it's not about your rights it's about
01:58:58 your responsibilities
01:59:00 as an american that's a bad line that's
01:59:02 not a great line i i get what he's
01:59:04 saying
01:59:04 at least he got through that without
01:59:05 stumbling he seems to be getting better
01:59:07 they're
01:59:08 they're injecting him with something
01:59:09 they're just getting better yeah no
01:59:11 legit yeah they got an alpha brain on an
01:59:13 iv drip yeah
01:59:14 right into his dick hole he's going
01:59:16 slower now because remember he used to
01:59:17 be fast and you got bro
01:59:19 he doesn't have a stutter you know he's
01:59:21 always had like a bit of an issue
01:59:23 what's the thing it's like aren't we
01:59:25 like
01:59:27 i don't know i just it's so depressing
01:59:29 that these people rule us but then you
01:59:31 also go
01:59:32 who even wants this fucking job and if
01:59:34 you if you're really talented and you
01:59:35 don't even want that job
01:59:36 who wants that fucking job i mean look
01:59:38 at this one she's indian she's black she
01:59:40 doesn't know what she is she's
01:59:41 everything
01:59:42 best for their health their well-being
01:59:45 and for their families
01:59:46 that's what real leadership looks like
01:59:50 and when joe talks about his priorities
01:59:53 he knows and he cares about the fact
01:59:56 that we have as a nation
01:59:58 witnessed a hundred and sixty five
02:00:01 thousand people who just in the last
02:00:05 few months have died in our country we
02:00:07 know that those individuals represent
02:00:09 families loved ones grandparents parents
02:00:12 sisters and brothers aunts and uncles
02:00:15 sisters
02:00:15 people those are all people she could
02:00:17 have put in jail
02:00:19 she's so upset she because we could have
02:00:21 put handcuffs on all of those kids
02:00:23 out there fighting wildfires they could
02:00:25 have been working for a walmart for
02:00:27 10 cents an hour in the kamala harris
02:00:29 prison program
02:00:31 yeah you know what are you going to do
02:00:33 it's just it's just
02:00:34 wild that these are uh our choices trump
02:00:39 or this crew or this uh old fella but
02:00:41 that's what i mean it's like this is
02:00:43 kind of the
02:00:43 beginning of the she makes sense to me
02:00:46 as a vice president like
02:00:47 you know yeah get away from all the
02:00:49 prisons she makes all the right
02:00:51 people feel comfortable yeah she makes
02:00:53 all the right like all the people that
02:00:54 need
02:00:55 uh somebody in there that will you know
02:00:58 check the boxes
02:00:59 check all the boxes yeah and uh who's
02:01:01 that guy
02:01:03 i don't like him
02:01:06 20 who is he i don't know
02:01:10 what does donald trump say oh he's
02:01:12 wearing a mask yeah
02:01:13 we unite night in our effort defeat
02:01:16 invisible china virus
02:01:19 and many people say that it is patriotic
02:01:22 to wear a face mask when you can't
02:01:24 socially distance
02:01:25 there is nobody more patriotic than me
02:01:27 your favorite president yeah this is the
02:01:29 end
02:01:30 i mean this is the end this is out of
02:01:32 the movie you tweeted to bill maher
02:01:33 today what did he say he went off on
02:01:35 bill maher oh because bill maher did
02:01:36 that thing about it
02:01:37 he did a eulogy for me yeah yeah he said
02:01:39 he wouldn't he wouldn't get eulogy so he
02:01:41 gave him
02:01:41 trump was not happy about that oh my god
02:01:44 let me
02:01:44 did you see what he said that's so funny
02:01:46 i didn't see that yeah i got it in here
02:01:48 somewhere
02:01:48 it's it's actually pretty funny he uh
02:01:53 it's just funny that he spent so much
02:01:54 time thinking about this
02:01:56 um he goes uh his ego is the thing man
02:02:00 that's the thing that really
02:02:02 watched bill maher last night for the
02:02:04 first time in a long time he's totally
02:02:06 shot looks terrible exhausted
02:02:09 gone and weak if there was ever a good
02:02:12 reason
02:02:13 for no shutdown check out this jerk
02:02:16 he never had much going for him but
02:02:20 whatever he did have is missing in
02:02:24 action
02:02:24 wow what a crazy tweet
02:02:29 the suburban housewife will be voting
02:02:30 for me they want safety and are thrilled
02:02:33 that i
02:02:34 ended long the long running program
02:02:36 where low-income housing would invade
02:02:38 their neighborhood
02:02:39 biden would reinstall it in a bigger
02:02:41 form with cory booker in charge
02:02:44 i mean this is kind of just very
02:02:45 race-baiting stuff you know
02:02:47 yeah he's basically like somehow yeah i
02:02:49 mean this is real
02:02:51 coded stuff you know that's kind of ugly
02:02:53 that's what they call a dog whistle yeah
02:02:56 dog whistle is a new thing dog whistles
02:02:58 new and a lot of the things they say dog
02:02:59 whistles aren't
02:03:00 they're just people are talking but when
02:03:02 you say stuff like that where you're
02:03:03 like
02:03:04 invade use words like that you're like
02:03:06 low-income housing is invading your
02:03:07 neighborhood you're kind of like
02:03:08 housewives
02:03:09 we know what you're doing here yeah the
02:03:10 housewives we know ms-13 climbing in the
02:03:12 window low income housing you know
02:03:15 it's you know but that's what he's this
02:03:17 is what he's doing do you think he gets
02:03:18 advised to say these things do you think
02:03:20 these things are no i don't think
02:03:21 anyone's advising him i think he's all
02:03:22 him
02:03:23 that's what's crazy right he's a he's a
02:03:25 creature and a creation
02:03:26 of all of the cultural trends that his
02:03:29 supporters hate
02:03:30 which are hollywood and big tech well he
02:03:33 is a creation of those two things one of
02:03:34 the most wild things recently was the
02:03:36 the bubba thing with the nascar with the
02:03:39 yeah
02:03:39 the noose yeah like what he was saying
02:03:41 that nascar screwing up the lowest
02:03:43 ratings ever
02:03:44 and uh first of all they had the problem
02:03:46 getting rid of the flag like
02:03:48 i mean the confederate yeah the
02:03:49 confederate flag not only that the
02:03:50 ratings aren't low
02:03:51 yeah how about what he said to the fox
02:03:53 news anchor when he when they go well uh
02:03:55 you know who's done more for black
02:03:56 people than me and they're like lincoln
02:03:58 and he's like well that's debatable
02:03:59 yeah and then she goes well we're free
02:04:01 mr president because yeah you're free
02:04:02 like that's wild it's just
02:04:05 it's just wild he's a problem he's off
02:04:08 the cuff he's not thinking enough
02:04:09 everything about the comic con yeah
02:04:12 it's a narcissist on a level that any no
02:04:15 one's really ever seen that before
02:04:16 in public life at this level and it just
02:04:19 should like he's the worst guy
02:04:21 in a crisis this is the worst guy you
02:04:22 would never you wouldn't want a guy
02:04:23 leading a boy scout troop in a hurricane
02:04:25 during this like no
02:04:26 this is a guy that just belittles people
02:04:28 uh
02:04:29 vindictive blames people he doesn't take
02:04:32 responsibility for anything there's a
02:04:33 smallness to him and it's all very funny
02:04:36 yeah like it's all hilarious but when
02:04:37 you talk about leading an organization
02:04:39 there's probably a lot of issues
02:04:40 there's a lot of issues yeah look at
02:04:42 that the hair
02:04:43 his hair is called suspect
02:04:47 after trump hair complaints what i don't
02:04:50 even know what that means
02:04:51 what does that mean talking about how
02:04:53 much water comes out of a shower head
02:04:54 and then like dishwashers and shit and
02:04:56 like people make fun of him for that but
02:04:57 why didn't he shave his head
02:04:59 he'd look great he'd be free that hair
02:05:02 is so much of his thing dude
02:05:04 yeah it's it's chaos it's exactly the
02:05:06 hair is like his brain itself
02:05:08 also shower heads you can't take a
02:05:10 shower the water doesn't come out
02:05:12 you want to wash your hands the water
02:05:13 doesn't come out so what do you do
02:05:15 you just stand there longer you take a
02:05:16 shower longer because my hair
02:05:18 i don't know about you but it has to be
02:05:20 perfect perfect
02:05:21 he says perfect because my hair
02:05:25 i don't know about you but it has to be
02:05:27 perfect
02:05:28 that's madness yeah well that's what he
02:05:30 should be focusing on right now
02:05:32 so his hair should be focusing on the
02:05:35 hair
02:05:35 and delmar show bill maher looking gaunt
02:05:38 yeah bill maher looking gaunt
02:05:40 i mean it'll be interesting to see these
02:05:42 debates are they going to have debates
02:05:44 they're going to have some version i
02:05:46 think kamala is going to be like
02:05:48 i got this she's going to be good with
02:05:50 pence she's pretty good
02:05:52 and uh but him and uh biden are going to
02:05:54 be very interesting but i don't know how
02:05:55 many people are going to watch i mean i
02:05:56 think a lot of people will watch
02:05:58 depending on the format i wonder how
02:05:59 many they'll actually have i mean
02:06:01 they're not going to be able to
02:06:02 be in the same room the way they used to
02:06:03 be where remember when the hillary thing
02:06:05 was going on where he was circling
02:06:06 behind him absolutely creepy
02:06:08 wild and then you remember the thing
02:06:09 where he brought the five women to the
02:06:11 debate to accuse bill clinton's live
02:06:13 right now and there's
02:06:14 72 people watching it no this is the
02:06:17 white house
02:06:18 72 likes no it can't be 72 people

02:06:45 applications coming in going all over
02:06:47 the state nobody even knows where they
02:06:49 came from you saw what happened in new
02:06:50 york which was
02:06:51 a disaster with congresswoman uh
02:06:54 carolyn maloney it was uh
02:06:58 it was a basic disaster it's it's a male
02:07:00 in voting
02:07:01 and we can give you many other locations
02:07:03 on sites what has happened
02:07:05 is that's part of a big negotiation
02:07:08 that's a actually small part of a big
02:07:09 negotiation he likes to do this
02:07:12 yeah let's do this it's small this is
02:07:14 his hands
02:07:15 here's what i understand there's all the
02:07:16 complicated stuff he brings it in yeah
02:07:19 this and then that it's a master like
02:07:21 he's like a master communicator but he's
02:07:23 it's like he's not but he is it's like a
02:07:26 weird
02:07:27 thing i told you that was likes 12 000
02:07:29 people but still i just clicked on the
02:07:31 james
02:07:31 still 12 000 people like shit it's not
02:07:34 exactly
02:07:34 for sure we could go live on youtube and
02:07:36 have 125 million yeah
02:07:38 yeah that's so crazy i mean he is he is
02:07:42 uh
02:07:42 it's been a while it's very interesting
02:07:44 i wonder about the kids that are growing
02:07:45 up under him
02:07:46 like the young kids that have no idea
02:07:48 about politics except for trump
02:07:50 like they've never had any experience
02:07:52 with anybody else this is what they know
02:07:54 a president is and they're going to vote
02:07:56 for the first time when he's in office
02:07:57 yeah
02:07:57 this is 15 year olds or 15 when he's
02:07:59 elected president talks
02:08:01 and that's why a lot of those kids are
02:08:03 going to this just
02:08:04 tic-tac-y like dancing and nihilism and
02:08:07 just being like yeah nothing means
02:08:08 anything and
02:08:09 they're right it's also i mean imagine
02:08:11 being a kid during the formative
02:08:13 time of your life the world gets shut
02:08:15 down you're stuck at home and you can't
02:08:16 even see your friends
02:08:17 you can't go to school you got to do
02:08:18 school over a laptop it's crazy it's
02:08:20 weird it's crazy my kids go to school
02:08:22 over laptops and i've sat in the room
02:08:24 and watched and those teachers could
02:08:26 when
02:08:26 when no one's watching the teacher i
02:08:28 don't care they don't give a
02:08:29 fuck right they're so bad they're so
02:08:31 apathetic yeah
02:08:32 some of them are great polish
02:08:36 i said that on my podcast the other day
02:08:38 i said abolish teachers
02:08:40 defund and abolish is that getting a lot
02:08:42 of press um
02:08:43 it's impossible no i tried to start a
02:08:45 movement it failed but i said if we're
02:08:46 gonna let people police themselves let
02:08:48 kids learn on their own abolish teachers
02:08:50 okay no cops no teachers yeah
02:08:53 what else i mean teachers have a much
02:08:55 worse track record than cops if you look
02:08:56 at the numbers well they don't get paid
02:08:58 as much as cops
02:08:59 well but still if cops were shooting as
02:09:01 many people as teachers were failing
02:09:06 i don't think it's that way i think
02:09:07 that's like teacher we would have to
02:09:09 make cops responsible for suicides too
02:09:11 then but here's the whole thing
02:09:12 teachers a lot of them are not doing a
02:09:14 good job yes but a lot of kids aren't
02:09:16 showing up
02:09:17 but if those those are the educational
02:09:19 suicides
02:09:20 i know but i'm saying that if if a lot
02:09:23 of a group
02:09:24 if we're going to broad brush a group i
02:09:26 like to do that
02:09:27 if we're going to broadbrush cops let's
02:09:28 broadbrush teachers get rid of them too
02:09:31 okay who else should we get rid of
02:09:33 garbage people take care of your own
02:09:35 garbage no we need them
02:09:37 we need them really when people don't
02:09:38 have a job
02:09:40 it's true how about that's where
02:09:41 universal basic income comes from
02:09:43 yeah get ready to get rid of cops
02:09:46 teachers firefighters
02:09:47 you never see a fire let's be honest i
02:09:49 see fires all the time no you don't oh
02:09:51 and they
02:09:52 evacuated three times they take care of
02:09:53 themselves the reality is
02:09:55 you never see a fire downtown in the
02:09:57 city these guys put the sirens on
02:09:59 they're going to a movie they're liars
02:10:00 sometimes they go down but they're white
02:10:03 supremacists
02:10:04 these firemen are white supremacists
02:10:06 they're about the black ones
02:10:09 multi-racial white supremacy endemic
02:10:12 white supremacy
02:10:14 they don't even know um yeah but i don't
02:10:17 know i mean there's no
02:10:17 there's there's very few good solutions
02:10:19 with coven with this it's like
02:10:21 we're gonna live in an imperfect world
02:10:23 we have to decide what version of an
02:10:25 imperfect world
02:10:26 is sustainable all right president yeah
02:10:28 you're the president president tim
02:10:30 dillon what do we do next
02:10:32 um what do we do next if you took over
02:10:36 right now
02:10:37 we'd have to do a universal basic income
02:10:41 for
02:10:42 six months we'd have to do an eviction
02:10:43 freeze probably where's the money come
02:10:45 from
02:10:46 um we print it like we've printed
02:10:49 everything else
02:10:50 yeah but you know how much money would
02:10:50 be involved in universal basic income
02:10:52 for like how many millions of americans
02:10:53 well
02:10:54 you could also do well it's a stimulus
02:10:56 they're doing it right now with the
02:10:57 stimulus right i think the bigger
02:10:58 problem is the eviction freeze you'd
02:11:00 have to freeze evictions
02:11:01 you've got to freeze that gotta freeze
02:11:02 down and mortgages as well mortgages
02:11:03 mortgages and rent yes
02:11:05 yeah um you know i would do that i think
02:11:08 that's the most
02:11:09 but for how long how long your freezer
02:11:11 for four months five months
02:11:12 six six you know and then then you would
02:11:15 have to kind of
02:11:16 open back up um you know i would put all
02:11:19 of
02:11:20 all the resources in energy there's
02:11:22 there's not a coordinated federal
02:11:23 response at corona it's all state
02:11:25 responses which i understand makes sense
02:11:27 to a certain degree because states are
02:11:28 dealing with different things but
02:11:30 there's been a lack of kind of a federal
02:11:32 i think
02:11:34 like targeted response of like here's
02:11:37 what we
02:11:38 hope happens here's what we get but
02:11:40 because i think right now people are
02:11:42 just living without the idea of hope
02:11:44 or the idea that something is going to
02:11:45 get better or reopen
02:11:47 and i think that like they need that and
02:11:48 that needs to be on a federal level like
02:11:50 the country needs to go
02:11:51 hey we're going to get moving again
02:11:52 we're going to be able to travel
02:11:53 internationally we're going to be able
02:11:54 to do all these things we used to do
02:11:56 here's what needs to happen first and
02:11:58 there doesn't seem to be a huge
02:12:00 you know push for that kind of clarity
02:12:03 my real fear
02:12:04 is the thing that we were talking about
02:12:06 earlier that businesses
02:12:07 are not going to have enough money to
02:12:09 reopen to reopen and that money won't be
02:12:11 available
02:12:11 so how do you get the economy back on
02:12:13 track well i think it's got to bottom
02:12:15 out probably and unfortunately you got
02:12:16 to protect vulnerable people but the
02:12:18 bottoming out
02:12:19 and i don't mean bottoming out
02:12:20 completely but the
02:12:22 real estate values being lowered uh all
02:12:24 of these things happening
02:12:26 you know will if it's going to be a
02:12:28 years long process i don't think it's
02:12:29 immediate i think it's years
02:12:31 and i think eventually what happens is
02:12:33 you know you have a situation where
02:12:35 because of economic turmoil you might
02:12:37 have
02:12:38 but yeah the businesses you're talking
02:12:40 about are probably fucked
02:12:41 but those people might have a shot in
02:12:43 three years when rents are lower
02:12:45 and your cost of financing is is is
02:12:48 potentially
02:12:49 you know probably not lower but maybe if
02:12:51 we keep the cost of financing low i mean
02:12:53 that's the other thing
02:12:54 interest rates are going to creep up and
02:12:56 it's just going to it's going to cost
02:12:57 people a lot of
02:12:58 a lot more money to borrow money so much
02:13:00 of the economy's run on just this cheap
02:13:02 credit that we've had since
02:13:04 you know obama's you know you know and
02:13:06 shift and all those guys explain it
02:13:07 where it's just like
02:13:08 we're just it's a it's a credit card and
02:13:09 we're just basically borrowing money at
02:13:12 close to no interest and
02:13:13 businesses are expanding and people are
02:13:15 able to get cars and go on vacations and
02:13:17 get
02:13:18 mortgages when those interest rates
02:13:20 creep up i mean it's just a perfect
02:13:21 storm of problems
02:13:23 jesus damn it's a lot of problems trying
02:13:24 to end this on a happy note
02:13:26 i mean listen three o'clock i'm trying
02:13:28 to like let's let's wrap it up in the
02:13:29 house here's the happiness
02:13:30 okay it's over enjoy it
02:13:34 it's over enjoy it it's over enjoy it
02:13:36 meaning that it's not gonna end like
02:13:38 crap like listen
02:13:39 we're gonna limp through this somehow
02:13:42 we're gonna be broken and beaten and
02:13:44 battered but we're gonna get through it
02:13:47 we need a war with china we need another
02:13:49 911 what
02:13:50 i hope the people that run us are
02:13:52 thinking of those things and i
02:13:53 bet they are really yeah we need a war
02:13:56 with china
02:13:57 a war with china we need a false flag
02:13:59 that gets us into a war with china but a
02:14:01 war with china kills everybody it kills
02:14:02 a lot of people but the rest of the
02:14:04 people
02:14:04 uh will open up coffee shops
02:14:07 glow-in-the-dark coffee
02:14:08 hey it is what it is i mean there's no
02:14:10 good waste out of this i think we
02:14:11 probably need a prolonged war with china
02:14:14 jesus christ and here's the other thing
02:14:15 before we leave can i say this yeah
02:14:18 can i say this war with china thing oh
02:14:20 and i don't want that but we need it
02:14:24 it's true who's closer to get us in the
02:14:26 war with china joe biden or trump
02:14:29 i i think i think trump looks like it
02:14:31 but i mean i think no matter who wins we
02:14:32 just we're just gonna need a world
02:14:33 champion it could be a cold war it
02:14:35 doesn't have to be a hot war
02:14:36 could be a cold war oh cool fun cold war
02:14:38 cold war they build a thing we
02:14:40 build a thing oh okay yeah we need that
02:14:42 because the whole economy is fake we
02:14:43 need that
02:14:44 um here's the other thing derek chauvin
02:14:46 needs to get epstein's in prison oh
02:14:48 jesus and here's why
02:14:49 they're not they're not going to convict
02:14:51 him on murder too because there's no
02:14:53 it's going to be a hard time proving
02:14:54 intent with that body cam footage
02:14:56 so what about the body cam footage well
02:14:59 i mean i don't know if they can
02:15:00 the body cam footage shows that this you
02:15:02 know they're floyd in the car that he's
02:15:04 out i mean listen everything shelvin did
02:15:06 was disgusting
02:15:07 and and horrible and but i don't know if
02:15:09 you're going to be able to prove to a
02:15:10 jury that he
02:15:11 intended to kill this guy murder him or
02:15:14 he was
02:15:15 subduing um a suspect who was
02:15:19 resisting arrest i mean he wasn't he
02:15:22 wasn't resisting arrest not at that
02:15:23 moment but he was like
02:15:25 like he was like but listen when
02:15:26 someone's resisting arrest when they
02:15:28 stop resisting
02:15:29 you're supposed to stop leaning your
02:15:30 knee on everything you did was
02:15:32 indefensible i'm just saying that's
02:15:33 murder too then if he dies from that
02:15:35 did he intend to kill him this is what
02:15:37 that's the whole thing it's intent
02:15:39 so the reality is i'm not that's crazy
02:15:41 that's like if you stab someone but you
02:15:42 didn't intend to kill listen i'm just
02:15:44 saying he can't get off
02:15:45 he can knock it off he can't get out so
02:15:48 i agree so
02:15:49 who is that guy that was epstein's
02:15:50 roommate the guy with the muscles
02:15:52 oh yeah he needs to go room with him
02:15:54 that's right
02:15:55 he needs to go room with him more with
02:15:56 china the big cop with the dogs
02:15:59 that's what needs to happen yeah these
02:16:00 are the solutions folks you may not like
02:16:02 them but they're the solutions tim
02:16:03 dillon ladies and gentlemen
02:16:04 thank you so much there's the guy he's
02:16:07 got to kill that guy we got to move on
02:16:09 okay and then we got to invade it looks

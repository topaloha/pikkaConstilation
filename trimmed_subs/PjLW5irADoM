00:01:45 know just different circuits
00:01:47 back chest you know whatever whatever
00:01:50 legs
00:01:50 and then um and then the other days i'm
00:01:52 always just trying to make sure i hit
00:01:53 the treadmill
00:01:54 twice a day for two miles twice a day
00:01:56 yeah yeah
00:01:57 really you do it twice a day yeah in the
00:01:59 morning and night i don't do much
00:02:00 otherwise so you know all especially now
00:02:03 a lot of my stuff is
00:02:04 sitting in front of a computer
00:02:06 podcasting and playing games on twitch
00:02:08 and stuff like that so
00:02:10 i feel like oh i'm going to spend all
00:02:12 that long i gotta
00:02:13 start the day treadmill end the day
00:02:15 treadmill that's discipline
00:02:16 i like that it is i fucking hate it so
00:02:20 it definitely is discipline but you like
00:02:22 the results
00:02:23 yeah i like how i feel i like the
00:02:25 compliments you know i was just doing
00:02:26 this thing the other day and um
00:02:28 uh jake johnson and the guy from new
00:02:30 girl i'm in a cartoon with him and like
00:02:32 that's like you know he's like a leading
00:02:33 man
00:02:34 dream boaty guy and he's looking at me
00:02:35 he's like man he's like you're looking
00:02:36 fucking good man you got your shit
00:02:38 together you look like you're about to
00:02:39 lead your own show and i hear shit like
00:02:41 that and i'm like okay
00:02:42 yeah i better get on that treadmill
00:02:44 again yeah
00:02:45 yeah that helps right it really does
00:02:47 yeah the positive feedback and positive
00:02:50 energy
00:02:50 that's one thing that i like about what
00:02:52 you do you are very positive like you're
00:02:54 you're very
00:02:55 warm and friendly like all the shit that
00:02:57 you do online
00:02:58 you're all smiley and positive and
00:03:01 friendly it's cool it's it's got it
00:03:03 gives off a good vibe like when i
00:03:05 look at your instagram posts or read
00:03:06 something that you post it's like
00:03:09 ron is on the good path yeah you know
00:03:12 because it's just
00:03:12 it's so easy to go the other way and get
00:03:15 caught up in what
00:03:16 other people are doing and what you
00:03:18 think you should be doing
00:03:20 which i battle all of that too so i
00:03:21 don't ever try to act like oh i'm just
00:03:24 like oh everything's great it's like of
00:03:26 course i go through shit all the time
00:03:27 but like
00:03:28 i think i choose to support my friends i
00:03:31 choose to support
00:03:32 positive things because that's what i
00:03:35 can control
00:03:36 and that's to me fighting against that
00:03:38 negative as opposed to like just joining
00:03:40 everybody in the fray yeah what do you
00:03:42 mean by like how do you feel like when
00:03:44 you say like
00:03:44 you feel that too like the feel you feel
00:03:46 the draw to the negative
00:03:48 oh i mean because we all like you know
00:03:51 we just
00:03:52 want things you know so i wanted a
00:03:55 netflix special i want to be a lead in a
00:03:57 show i want my own show
00:03:59 you know and i've already do a lot of
00:04:01 great things but
00:04:02 and that's why i have to balance it out
00:04:03 because i'm like well man i'm in such a
00:04:04 great position i do
00:04:06 so many wonderful things i what always
00:04:08 helps me actually is talking to people
00:04:10 like you or talking to people like bert
00:04:12 talking to any comedian that's been
00:04:14 doing it
00:04:15 like 20 years plus when i'm at like 14
00:04:18 now
00:04:18 and when i talk to them and then they
00:04:20 are like oh hold on slow the fuck down
00:04:22 man
00:04:22 like you look at where you are and what
00:04:25 you're doing for how long you've been
00:04:26 doing it you're fucking aces man so
00:04:28 chill the fuck out and
00:04:30 play it out don't freak out and that
00:04:32 that
00:04:33 always you know having faith that always
00:04:35 helped me out well we're all stalls
00:04:36 right now
00:04:37 yeah unfortunately because we can't work
00:04:39 but uh
00:04:40 stand up is a long haul like you're
00:04:43 at ten years people start taking you
00:04:45 seriously you know if you're really
00:04:47 precocious people start looking at you
00:04:48 at seven like damn this motherfucker's
00:04:50 good
00:04:50 but at ten years they go okay that guy's
00:04:53 a pro
00:04:53 or she's really got it she's legit 10
00:04:56 years usually
00:04:57 so for 14 man you're cooking you know 14
00:05:01 you got things happening you know you're
00:05:02 putting together like real sets you got
00:05:05 string like you get off stage you're
00:05:06 like damn that's that was legit
00:05:08 that was legit it's fucking it's a long
00:05:11 road
00:05:11 to get good at stand up you know it's
00:05:14 like that ac dc song it's a long way to
00:05:16 the top
00:05:16 if you want to rock and roll i was on
00:05:19 stage
00:05:20 or not about to go on stage rather at
00:05:22 the
00:05:23 improv once and there was this lady
00:05:24 who's on stage and she you could tell
00:05:26 she's real recent
00:05:28 and uh she was just eating it just
00:05:30 eating shit up there
00:05:31 and me and the dj were just like i just
00:05:34 looked and i'm like oh it's a long way
00:05:36 to the top if you want to rock and roll
00:05:38 [Laughter]
00:05:42 and then the dj played that song as i
00:05:44 went on stage
00:05:45 that's a long way to the top it is man
00:05:48 it's a fucking long way
00:05:49 yeah no and i agree and that's what i
00:05:52 had to change my mindset very early
00:05:54 because you know i came from not having
00:05:56 money not having anything and having my
00:05:58 son
00:05:58 really early and so i was like i need to
00:06:00 make it i need to do this and then like
00:06:02 i remember
00:06:03 um i got on conan the first time and and
00:06:06 i
00:06:06 they were like oh what are you promoting
00:06:07 you got to promote something you know
00:06:09 when we introduce you and the only thing
00:06:10 i had to promote was an open mic that i
00:06:12 was doing in portland the next day
00:06:15 and i was just like this is always going
00:06:17 to be a part of this this is always
00:06:19 going to be
00:06:20 here it's always going to be a there
00:06:21 will be highs and then there'll be
00:06:22 another day
00:06:23 and so i gotta learn to not you know
00:06:26 fear that next day and just be like this
00:06:28 is
00:06:28 i mean this is just my life and that's
00:06:29 what helps me through all of this
00:06:31 quarantine stuff that's why i'm back
00:06:33 doing
00:06:33 weird zoom shows i'm doing my own live
00:06:35 stream show september 5th and
00:06:37 people adapt yeah exactly exactly yeah
00:06:40 the best at it so far i've seen is
00:06:41 andrew schultz andrew schultz
00:06:43 has adapted the best because he's really
00:06:45 figured out a whole new kind of a format
00:06:47 he's figured out how to do these like
00:06:48 10-minute chunks
00:06:50 on a particular subject like rapid fire
00:06:53 with images behind him and his style of
00:06:55 comedy and it's it's i'd be calling a
00:06:56 quarantine comedy
00:06:57 because it's like there's no one in the
00:06:59 room with him it's just
00:07:00 you know and it's high production value
00:07:02 and it's it's without network notes it's
00:07:04 without and it's him being able to
00:07:06 to distill his voice without anybody
00:07:09 telling him what to do so then when you
00:07:10 watch it compared to
00:07:12 things you're seeing on tv which now
00:07:14 because they're forced to scale back
00:07:16 start looking very similar
00:07:18 you're like why the fuck would i watch
00:07:20 this yeah he's so much more fun
00:07:22 yeah yeah schultz is so much funnier
00:07:24 than those guys
00:07:25 those guys are forced to do tv kind of
00:07:27 comedy for the internet
00:07:29 and that shit is not good enough tv kind
00:07:31 of comedy is okay if you have tv kind of
00:07:34 restrictions you know that
00:07:35 those restrictions that they have for
00:07:37 language and content
00:07:38 then you can get away with it but if you
00:07:40 could just you know if you're forced to
00:07:42 compete in that
00:07:43 internet realm like the internet is wild
00:07:46 man yeah it's the wild west
00:07:47 it's fucking full-on wild west you know
00:07:50 this show like you could never do this
00:07:51 fucking show
00:07:52 no one will ever allow me to do this
00:07:54 show anywhere else the only way it would
00:07:55 have ever worked
00:07:56 is to have no one telling you what to do
00:07:58 the thing about
00:07:59 um those feelings that you get when you
00:08:02 see other people doing stuff and good
00:08:03 things happen in them you're like ugh i
00:08:04 want that i want that
00:08:06 that's fuel man that's the key is like
00:08:09 how you harness that fuel
00:08:10 you can pour it all over yourself and
00:08:12 let yourself on fire which a lot of
00:08:14 people do
00:08:15 like you know yeah we see it all the
00:08:17 time all the time or
00:08:18 you can just go i'm gonna work harder
00:08:21 i'm gonna
00:08:21 fucking just buckle down i'm gonna stay
00:08:24 focused
00:08:25 and i'm going to somehow another
00:08:28 be my best self be the best version yeah
00:08:31 i never deny
00:08:32 jealousy you know to me that's like
00:08:34 that's just lying to people
00:08:36 when you say like oh i don't get jealous
00:08:38 like right i
00:08:39 uh would when i was a very young comic i
00:08:41 would listen read
00:08:42 patent oswalt's dispute and i think he
00:08:45 wrote something he was wrote jealousy as
00:08:46 a map of where you want to be and i was
00:08:48 like oh
00:08:49 if i just look at it like that that's a
00:08:51 lot easier for me to swallow that's a
00:08:53 wise way of looking at it yeah
00:08:55 you also one thing that for me when i
00:08:58 first started doing stand-up i was real
00:08:59 jealous
00:09:00 and i also um i also didn't like
00:09:04 comedy anymore i didn't like other
00:09:06 people's comedy because i would be
00:09:07 jealous like i would watch someone kill
00:09:08 and i'd go oh why didn't i come up with
00:09:10 that joke oh my god he's so much better
00:09:11 than me
00:09:12 oh my god he's killing shit like i want
00:09:14 to be like that
00:09:16 and then i realized like oh my god i've
00:09:17 stopped enjoying comedy
00:09:19 and now i'm not a fan anymore and one of
00:09:21 the things that switched with me
00:09:23 is i realized that i was i had a very
00:09:25 weak
00:09:26 perspective on it instead of being
00:09:28 inspired and instead of being like
00:09:31 energized i was like wishing that they
00:09:34 would do badly which is a real common
00:09:37 thing like you you see someone who's
00:09:38 doing much better than you and you
00:09:40 actually hope they fail
00:09:41 yeah well you see a lot of people once
00:09:43 you see them start succeeding a bit
00:09:45 i i've noticed in general you stop
00:09:47 seeing people
00:09:48 champion them you know they stop they're
00:09:50 like oh well you've made it as far as i
00:09:52 wanted you to
00:09:55 and they call you a sellout oh my god
00:09:57 you sell
00:09:58 out but i love being inspired that i've
00:10:00 never had like i've always
00:10:02 been inspired by comedy i've always
00:10:04 loved comedy and
00:10:05 i i sure there's comedy i love more than
00:10:08 others but i've always learned to go
00:10:09 like well that's not for me
00:10:10 you know i respect their craft i respect
00:10:12 the way they put that together but that
00:10:14 was not
00:10:14 for me um but i always looked at it like
00:10:17 rap where it's like man you look at like
00:10:18 the old death row records or
00:10:20 then they always were sharpening each
00:10:22 other by how good
00:10:24 each individual was and i look at comedy
00:10:26 the same way where it's like
00:10:28 oh if i see an amazing set i'm not like
00:10:30 trying to steal that joke or trying to
00:10:32 that but i'm going like oh fuck i gotta
00:10:34 raise my game yeah well that was one of
00:10:35 the best things that we had at the store
00:10:37 absolutely we were all working together
00:10:39 and you know we'd have a show on it to
00:10:41 be you and me and burr and
00:10:43 you know and eliza and whitney and
00:10:46 fucking
00:10:46 ali wong and bang bang bang bang bang
00:10:49 these shows were fire
00:10:51 it was just and you had a warm up in the
00:10:53 back i'd be in the back i'd be jumping
00:10:54 up down on cushions and shit
00:10:56 shadow boxing and touching my toes
00:10:59 taking deep breaths and
00:11:00 you gotta you know you gotta get your
00:11:02 body charged up you know
00:11:04 i missed that i missed that a lot i
00:11:06 missed that a lot i missed that feeling
00:11:07 of being the main room green room
00:11:09 getting ready to go on
00:11:11 whoo and just the hang man yeah mr hang
00:11:14 oh truly i mean that's
00:11:15 for me especially because i was still
00:11:17 always looking at it as like oh i'm
00:11:19 the young guy on the totem pole here and
00:11:20 it's cool that not you know
00:11:23 it's one thing the original room is
00:11:24 awesome but when you're on these main
00:11:25 room shows you know
00:11:26 like oh they're putting me on here
00:11:28 because they also think i'm
00:11:30 a part of a draw and so be on that with
00:11:33 you guys but
00:11:34 being younger in the game than you guys
00:11:36 and being like oh fuck
00:11:38 i have to follow ally joe joey diaz
00:11:42 you know whitney i have to follow them
00:11:43 all and then i don't have the credits
00:11:46 that these people are going to care
00:11:47 about it was the thing i've learned to
00:11:49 crave of being like because when i got
00:11:51 them i was like
00:11:52 they are on my side because i'm fucking
00:11:55 good
00:11:56 they don't know anything else they don't
00:11:57 know what i've done right they have now
00:11:59 figured out i'm good and that i miss so
00:12:02 much
00:12:04 i was there once and i brought you up
00:12:07 and you you said something to along the
00:12:09 lines of joe reminds me of that teacher
00:12:12 that got arrested for having sex with a
00:12:14 he's with a senior or something
00:12:18 like he's like that cool teacher yeah
00:12:20 that you find out he tells you all the
00:12:21 cool stuff he tells you how the real
00:12:23 world works and then you find out he was
00:12:24 having a relationship
00:12:28 the teacher's age i was crying
00:12:31 i was crying but it's like those kind of
00:12:34 moments man
00:12:34 it's like the the camaraderie of the
00:12:37 store um
00:12:38 one of the best things about the
00:12:39 quarantine is being able to do this
00:12:41 podcast and have guys like you on and
00:12:43 have all you know all of our friends
00:12:45 come here and and just sit down and just

00:13:50 well i'll see you tomorrow and now i
00:13:52 don't
00:13:53 see nobody ever i remember when we were
00:13:55 shutting down in march

00:13:58 man i'm just gonna buckle down
00:14:00 work out a lot write you know come june
00:14:02 or whatever the fuck this is over
00:14:04 i'll come back guns blazing you know and
00:14:06 then when i realized
00:14:08 that there was gonna be a second
00:14:09 lockdown and then there was gonna be no
00:14:11 return
00:14:12 and here we are in august and there's no
00:14:14 sight it's not going to happen it's not
00:14:16 going to happen until 2021
00:14:17 there's there's no way i was like
00:14:20 fuck like this is terrible this is a
00:14:24 terrible feeling
00:14:25 i could never would have imagined that i
00:14:27 would have to worry about comedy clubs
00:14:28 going under
00:14:29 but they're going under all over the
00:14:30 place man they just can't stay open
00:14:33 it's crazy yeah no i mean i was in the
00:14:36 exact same boat i think
00:14:37 anything most of us were just like okay
00:14:39 well i can i can last
00:14:40 i'll put it together just treat it like
00:14:43 i'm in a short-term prison sentence and
00:14:45 just
00:14:46 work out and get my ged and just
00:14:49 get it all together become a lawyer yeah
00:14:53 go over my case yeah yeah and then yeah
00:14:57 same thing that second lockdown happened
00:14:58 and something happened in my brain where
00:15:00 i was like okay i'm gonna have to just
00:15:02 because before i was like oh no zoom
00:15:03 shows nothing like that i don't like how
00:15:05 it's fucking with my rhythm i don't like
00:15:06 how i'm not getting feedback
00:15:09 um but after that i was like you know i
00:15:11 just kind of have to
00:15:12 adapt and go with the flow and hope
00:15:15 things change and know that things
00:15:17 change in time no matter what but
00:15:19 if this is how it is i got to stop
00:15:21 fighting it and start just like
00:15:23 you know finding my lane in it so you
00:15:26 know
00:15:26 i'm just trying to do that now yeah um
00:15:30 you have a podcast luckily i felt bad
00:15:33 for dudes who didn't
00:15:34 yes for the folks the guys and the gals
00:15:36 that didn't have podcasts i was like ooh
00:15:39 like you got no way to keep in touch
00:15:40 with people yeah
00:15:42 i mean and that was exactly the reason
00:15:43 why i started my podcast because i was
00:15:45 like oh
00:15:45 i'm like everything i'm doing is a guest
00:15:48 in other people's shit like i'm a guest
00:15:50 in everyone else's home
00:15:51 and i don't have a home for people to
00:15:53 come and hang out with me
00:15:54 yeah and so i've been thinking that for
00:15:57 a long time and that's the reason why i
00:15:58 started my podcast and when all this
00:16:00 stuff happened i was like
00:16:01 i was very happy um
00:16:04 because i've always been in two minds
00:16:06 when it comes to comedy i love
00:16:07 specialists i love people who are just
00:16:08 like i do stand up straight stand up
00:16:10 i'm gonna be the best fucking stand-up
00:16:12 in the world like i love being that
00:16:13 competitive
00:16:14 but i also have this part of me that's
00:16:16 just like i love new challenges of all
00:16:18 types and so i got into voice acting
00:16:20 regular act and all that stuff
00:16:21 and when this thing came down i was like
00:16:22 oh fuck actually you know just like in
00:16:25 business
00:16:25 it is good to diversify because voice
00:16:28 acting is saving my fucking life right
00:16:30 now
00:16:31 yeah yeah as a person in show business
00:16:34 you must have
00:16:36 as many forms of revenue as you can
00:16:39 really ha
00:16:39 and you have to save for a rainy day you
00:16:41 have to do those two things
00:16:42 i've been real lucky that i have weird
00:16:44 taste i'm into weird shit so i have
00:16:47 you know cage fighting commentary and
00:16:49 then i also have the podcast and i also
00:16:51 have
00:16:52 this stand-up thing which is just
00:16:55 on hold indefinitely you know you could
00:16:58 do it
00:16:59 right now i mean have you thought about
00:17:00 doing one of those uh drive-in movie
00:17:02 shows
00:17:03 i talked to a bird about it he made it
00:17:04 sound interesting yeah he loves it the
00:17:06 way he sells it made it sound fun
00:17:09 uh but you got to realize he's drunk
00:17:10 though yeah i do and i realized
00:17:15 i do realize that he's like
00:17:18 horns yeah he likes horns and people
00:17:22 high beaming him
00:17:24 like explain he's like dude it's like a
00:17:26 ufo but i'm actually um i've been
00:17:28 talking with chris titus
00:17:29 because he know he has his own little
00:17:31 production studio i shouldn't call it
00:17:32 little because he has his own
00:17:33 productions you know i don't
00:17:34 know i don't have no fucking production
00:17:35 studio he has his own big-ass production
00:17:38 studio
00:17:39 and he's been shooting his own specials
00:17:41 and his own
00:17:42 he's doing a reunion of the tightest
00:17:44 show through it and so i reached out to
00:17:46 him
00:17:46 and i'm going to do like a live stream
00:17:48 show where we have 10 people in the
00:17:49 audience and then we'll be live
00:17:51 streaming it out on youtube on september

00:18:01 yeah so what do you do you test those
00:18:03 folks yeah you do it
00:18:04 yeah well you know they'll be way not
00:18:07 like you
00:18:08 where you had where i took the full test
00:18:09 but it'll be temperature checks and
00:18:11 waivers and
00:18:11 they have they'll be wearing masks
00:18:13 they'll be wearing masks and they'll be
00:18:14 social existence yeah
00:18:16 it can be done man you know texas is
00:18:17 doing that with restaurants you can go
00:18:19 to a restaurant texas everybody wears a
00:18:20 mask
00:18:21 simple they space the tables out
00:18:23 everybody wears a mask good ventilation
00:18:25 server wears a mask and they're not
00:18:27 having any problems you know
00:18:28 with this draconian laws they've
00:18:31 instituted in california this is the
00:18:32 only state where you can't go to the
00:18:33 barber shop
00:18:34 do you know that i did not know every
00:18:36 other fucking state in the entire union
00:18:37 you can go to a barber shop you can get
00:18:39 a hairdresser and get your hair done i
00:18:40 don't
00:18:40 have an issue with that obviously i'm
00:18:42 bald as fuck
00:18:43 but i just think it's crazy this the the
00:18:46 restrictions that the states put on
00:18:47 businesses
00:18:48 it's forcing people to flee that's part
00:18:51 of what's going on here
00:18:52 that's one reason you're leaving yeah i
00:18:54 just think there's too many folks here
00:18:56 too
00:18:57 i think as i get older i realize
00:19:00 there are there's drawbacks to high
00:19:03 population areas there's
00:19:05 tension in high population areas and
00:19:07 when things go
00:19:08 south when natural disasters or
00:19:11 and you know what we're dealing with
00:19:13 with covid things along those lines
00:19:15 it's just a bad place to be man it's
00:19:17 just not safe it's not healthy it's not
00:19:19 wise like uh i like calmer
00:19:22 i like a little calmer because i'm i'm
00:19:24 my problem is not getting
00:19:26 up for things like i have a friend who
00:19:28 lives in new york city and he loves it
00:19:30 because like oh i love the energy of the
00:19:31 city everything's happening
00:19:32 yeah like i don't need that i got a lot
00:19:34 of energy i need
00:19:36 chill i need down time i need i need a
00:19:38 place where i could
00:19:40 you need space you need a fortress of
00:19:42 solitude i need relaxation i need to
00:19:44 balance and whenever i'd go to places
00:19:46 that were more rural
00:19:47 there was like nature and trees and shit
00:19:48 i always feel better
00:19:50 i understand that about i mean it's one
00:19:52 of the reasons why i like
00:19:54 where i live in the valley because i
00:19:56 like being i've always been outside
00:19:57 when i started comedy i started coming
00:20:00 in portland oregon but i lived in salem
00:20:01 oregon and i just made that 45 minute
00:20:03 drive because i did like
00:20:05 going into a thing doing my job and then
00:20:08 leaving that there
00:20:09 getting back home yeah that's how i felt
00:20:11 about hollywood
00:20:12 like i lived in north hollywood when i
00:20:14 first got here and i just kept moving
00:20:16 further out then i moved to encino and
00:20:17 i'm like i gotta go further out and then
00:20:18 i went
00:20:19 way out yeah man yeah that is true like
00:20:22 this lifestyle is so weird if it will
00:20:26 get you so wrapped up in other people's
00:20:28 information and
00:20:29 partying and shit and this one of the
00:20:31 reasons like i love like i got my little
00:20:34 small town canadian wife and
00:20:36 my son who you know i think that's who's
00:20:38 been my balance the whole time is that i
00:20:40 started comedy my son was already three
00:20:42 years old so
00:20:43 he one was like you need to be feeding
00:20:45 me with this
00:20:46 and b i don't give a shit about your
00:20:48 jokes or we're hanging out at all so
00:20:50 you know i would like to be here and
00:20:52 have you hanging out with me
00:20:53 right so that's always i think that's
00:20:55 one of the reasons i've been able to
00:20:57 be as successful as i am is that i was
00:20:59 like i don't give a fuck about hanging
00:21:00 i don't give a fuck about uh and there's
00:21:02 a lot of fear that comes out right
00:21:04 because people are always like oh i want
00:21:04 to be part of the group i won't be part
00:21:06 of the clique and if i'm not hanging i'm
00:21:07 not part of click and i was just like
00:21:08 well they'll know i'm fucking good at
00:21:10 comedy
00:21:10 yeah and they'll like me from that
00:21:12 you've never had a problem with that i
00:21:13 mean yeah
00:21:14 that's one of the things about the store
00:21:15 it's a real meritocracy
00:21:17 you'll hear people say like oh you know
00:21:19 like there's clicks there and they don't
00:21:22 accept you i think that's horseshit
00:21:24 if you're funny it doesn't nobody gives
00:21:26 a fuck of your
00:21:27 gay straight trans white chinese black
00:21:30 fucking puerto rican nobody gives a fuck
00:21:33 are you
00:21:34 funny yeah and if you're funny you're in
00:21:36 that place is a hundred percent
00:21:37 inclusive if you're funny you're in
00:21:39 you know it's it's it's you're accepted
00:21:42 for what you
00:21:43 what the kind of heat you bring you know
00:21:45 when you get on that stage and light
00:21:47 that place up
00:21:48 you don't have to hang out you have to
00:21:50 be one of the you know one of the people
00:21:51 that parties and drinks
00:21:52 they don't give a fuck they know you're
00:21:54 funny yeah i mean i've seen you
00:21:56 murder you know when you when you can
00:21:59 lay it down the way you do
00:22:00 you just accept it it's just how it is
00:22:03 it's a beautiful thing
00:22:04 really it's like that stu the the
00:22:07 art form of comedy we all know how hard
00:22:10 it is to get to that
00:22:11 14-year spot like you're at and you know
00:22:13 there's a lot of people that have 14
00:22:14 years and not as funny as you they're
00:22:16 for whatever reason psychologically
00:22:18 they've not figured it out artistically
00:22:20 they're not true to themselves whatever
00:22:21 it is they've never found that
00:22:23 and i think i bet having a child and
00:22:27 having that
00:22:27 that intense responsibility you know
00:22:31 when you're starting out
00:22:32 you know being an open micro and also
00:22:35 having a child like whew
00:22:37 that is that is extreme that's an
00:22:39 extreme amount of responsibility
00:22:41 yeah i agree and i've talked about it
00:22:43 with the other comics that i know that
00:22:44 our parents because we'll make fun of
00:22:47 of the laziness of other comedies
00:22:49 because they'll be like oh man i gotta
00:22:51 do this set at midnight and then i got a
00:22:53 meeting at noon how am i gonna do and
00:22:55 i'll just be like well
00:22:57 before i came to this set i helped my
00:22:58 son with his homework i got to get him
00:23:00 up on the school bus at six a.m
00:23:01 and then you know so like i don't have
00:23:03 any fucking sympathy for you
00:23:08 yeah well one of the things that i loved
00:23:10 before the store closed down was my
00:23:12 schedule was basically
00:23:14 i would put my kids to sleep they would
00:23:16 go to bed at like
00:23:17 you know 8 30 9 o'clock and then i would
00:23:21 go over my notes
00:23:22 and then i'd have a set at like 10 30.
00:23:24 it was it was perfect
00:23:25 and then when i would come home
00:23:26 everybody would be asleep so i'd just
00:23:28 hang out with the dog and write
00:23:29 you a chance to come down and not have
00:23:31 anybody talk to you
00:23:32 nothing man just quiet that's the
00:23:34 balance man yeah that's what it's
00:23:36 that's what for me that's so that's so
00:23:38 big balance is so big
00:23:40 you have to have it you can't just be
00:23:42 all about because i think
00:23:44 you know miyamoto musashi was he's a
00:23:47 samurai
00:23:48 from the um the 15th century he wrote
00:23:51 this crazy book called the book of five
00:23:52 rings
00:23:53 it's all about strategy and and how to
00:23:56 be
00:23:56 the best at whatever you do
00:24:00 and one of the things that he said is
00:24:01 like you have to have the same you
00:24:04 you have to do all things with the same
00:24:07 intensity and energy
00:24:08 like you you can't just be a guy who has
00:24:10 to kill people with a sword
00:24:12 he was excellent at calligraphy he was
00:24:14 an artist
00:24:15 he wrote poetry he he believed that you
00:24:18 had to have a balance
00:24:20 as a person otherwise those flaws would
00:24:23 show up in your sword fighting
00:24:25 oh that's amazing yeah i love that
00:24:27 that's i've
00:24:28 always that strikes me hard because i've
00:24:30 always believed that in my comedy from
00:24:32 the day i started
00:24:33 i was always like oh i can never let my
00:24:36 life
00:24:37 get far away from my persona that i
00:24:39 present on stage i can you know
00:24:41 always be turning ourselves up to 11 or
00:24:43 whatever but i go
00:24:45 from just my experience and my love of
00:24:47 comedy i go oh when people get
00:24:49 too far from their persona in any
00:24:51 general way and they're lying to you
00:24:54 it just starts falling apart and they
00:24:56 start showing in their act and it shows
00:24:57 in their life and i've always that was
00:25:00 is what gives me material because i just
00:25:02 talk about whatever is
00:25:03 active in my life as opposed to being
00:25:05 like well this is who i
00:25:07 because if i did that i had been stuck
00:25:08 when i was 23 just being like i'm the
00:25:10 fat
00:25:10 stoner guy you know right right right
00:25:14 yeah yeah you could get caught up in
00:25:16 your act right
00:25:17 yes this uh look there's a lot of
00:25:19 examples of that
00:25:20 the even successful ones like kennison
00:25:22 kennison is like it's a great example
00:25:24 bobcat for up until very recently
00:25:28 yeah he um on this podcast talked about
00:25:30 how hard it was to kick
00:25:31 and people like yay man do that scream
00:25:33 things like fuck you
00:25:35 i'm done man you didn't want to do it
00:25:39 yeah he um he got stuck he got trapped
00:25:43 emo phillips he's another one you know i
00:25:45 mean emo was like in his fucking 60s now
00:25:47 he's still got to do that
00:25:49 weird sort of thing that he did when he
00:25:51 was 20
00:25:52 that was kind of cute you know when
00:25:55 you're 60
00:25:56 everybody's like man is you having a
00:25:57 stroke like what's going on up there
00:25:58 buddy
00:25:59 yeah and that one does still hurt me
00:26:00 because he's such a tremendous joke
00:26:02 right
00:26:02 yes amazing joke writer but i do see
00:26:05 that
00:26:06 yeah it's like you have to kind of you
00:26:08 can't just go up there and start talking
00:26:10 you can't just be yourself yes yeah
00:26:12 which at one point when you know that's
00:26:14 what i'm learning as you get into it
00:26:15 people start
00:26:16 caring less and less about like oh
00:26:18 that's a crazy ass joke he wrote and
00:26:19 they want to know more about like who
00:26:21 who are you right yeah yeah
00:26:24 the another but we were talking about
00:26:26 kennison he was the guy who got really
00:26:27 caught up in it because his thing was
00:26:29 partying
00:26:30 like he he couldn't go anywhere without
00:26:31 partying it's like guys
00:26:33 line up giant lines of coke for me like
00:26:35 oh here we go
00:26:38 and his heart would be beating out of
00:26:39 his chest and couldn't you know couldn't
00:26:41 sleep for a week and
00:26:42 this comedy was suffering like real bad
00:26:44 i always point to him
00:26:45 as a great example for comedians of
00:26:48 someone who was so good for a short
00:26:51 period of time
00:26:52 and then was so bad afterwards he he was
00:26:55 so good around like 85 86
00:26:59 that was like the louder than hell days
00:27:01 like dude he was revolutionary like
00:27:02 nobody had ever seen anything like that
00:27:04 a short fat preacher
00:27:06 go on stage screaming and talking
00:27:09 screaming you ever been married look at
00:27:10 me look at me like this is marriage
00:27:13 oh oh like i was married twice that's
00:27:16 how fucking dumb i am
00:27:17 and you would see him and it was like
00:27:20 this force of nature
00:27:21 but with great material great insight
00:27:23 great points
00:27:24 and then all of it went away and then it
00:27:26 was like cheerleading
00:27:28 it was like weird like i remember he had
00:27:29 this bit about drunk driving he's like
00:27:31 we're gonna drink and we're gonna drive
00:27:33 and we're gonna pull it off you know why
00:27:35 because we do it every fucking night
00:27:38 and it's like what yeah and then he was
00:27:40 killed by a drunk driver
00:27:41 yeah which is crazy yeah i hate that so
00:27:44 i always
00:27:45 hate when people use their charm and
00:27:47 they use their tricks to push apart
00:27:49 false premises you're fucking lying i
00:27:51 think he was just trying to do it just
00:27:53 to
00:27:54 be his brother wrote about it his
00:27:56 brother um
00:27:57 bill wrote a book called brother sam was
00:27:59 a really good book
00:28:00 for someone who's a kennison fan really
00:28:03 interesting we talked about it pretty
00:28:04 openly about
00:28:05 sam just stopped writing his material
00:28:07 fell apart
00:28:08 and he just became like a shadow of
00:28:10 himself like a
00:28:11 open mic or doing a kenneson impression
00:28:13 with like shitty material
00:28:15 it's sad it is but it's a lesson for us
00:28:18 yeah you know like you gotta stay on
00:28:21 your fucking game
00:28:23 and then there's also the problem when
00:28:25 um people know who you are
00:28:27 they come to see you you know that's ron
00:28:29 funches uh we're gonna go see him and
00:28:31 like we're excited to see you
00:28:32 and everything you say i'm happy to hear
00:28:34 you could you get your crowd
00:28:37 and the problem is if you're only doing
00:28:38 comedy to your crowd you could
00:28:40 really delude yourself oh absolutely but
00:28:43 i think that's
00:28:44 why people who are good like to go
00:28:46 around to all the different spots i love
00:28:48 to go around and do
00:28:49 like house parties and the comedy store
00:28:52 and my shows on the road you do house

00:31:02 he's dutch so uh he talks to me yeah i i
00:31:06 had a dutch kickboxing trainer for a
00:31:07 while
00:31:08 they have a different way of talking the
00:31:10 dutch way
00:31:11 yeah yeah they don't understand
00:31:13 america's there's
00:31:15 you're so fat why you don't have to be
00:31:19 what are you eating your friend
00:31:22 it is very simple what kind of foods
00:31:25 [Laughter]
00:31:27 that dutch is a weird country holland
00:31:29 because if you
00:31:30 you know like i don't know if you know
00:31:31 this but they have some of the greatest
00:31:33 kickboxers of all time
00:31:34 all came out of holland real weird like
00:31:37 a few guys went over to thailand started
00:31:39 training in thailand
00:31:41 and uh fighting in thailand and they
00:31:43 brought it back to holland and then
00:31:44 holland became like this gigantic
00:31:46 kickboxing epicenter that's crazy i
00:31:48 didn't know that i didn't know some of
00:31:50 the baddest motherfuckers of all time
00:31:52 come from holland
00:31:54 yeah a place known for like weed shops
00:31:56 and red light district and mushrooms
00:31:58 that's why i go that's one of my
00:32:01 favorite places to visit
00:32:02 yeah yeah four times i've been to
00:32:04 amsterdam i've never been
00:32:06 i love it and it's not even you know you
00:32:08 can get just as good if not better we
00:32:10 here
00:32:11 in california for sure but it's just the
00:32:13 vibe it's just the lack of anyone ever
00:32:15 being like oh you dumb stoner
00:32:18 none of that like i remember i was
00:32:20 sitting in a coffee shop
00:32:22 and a guy tried to sneak a beer in and
00:32:24 then they kicked him out and like no
00:32:26 drinking and i was like
00:32:27 i like it here
00:32:31 yeah it's funny what we chose to
00:32:34 allow and not allow yeah well
00:32:37 where i'm going in texas you still i
00:32:39 mean austin
00:32:40 it's legal essentially they've
00:32:42 decriminalized it to the point where the
00:32:43 cops won't arrest anybody for weed
00:32:46 you mean they don't want you selling
00:32:47 large quantities of it but it's still
00:32:49 not legal it's still not legal statewide
00:32:51 it's it's the dumbest thing to make
00:32:53 illegal just to make
00:32:54 zero sense you know i see i
00:32:57 see the argument for making alcohol
00:32:59 illegal but i would never agree with it
00:33:01 i think people should be able to do
00:33:02 whatever they want yeah i'm with that
00:33:05 but the argument for weed being illegal
00:33:06 is the dumbest
00:33:07 just personal
00:33:11 but we have so many arguments that we're
00:33:13 not really good at it
00:33:14 yeah so well look at what's happened
00:33:17 with kovic yeah
00:33:18 that's the best i mean if you look at
00:33:20 what we're so bad at it
00:33:22 america is so bad our response to covet
00:33:25 and how how we've handled it and allowed
00:33:28 it to spread we're the worst
00:33:29 yeah i mean you know i'm a big pro
00:33:31 wrestling fan and that's the thing
00:33:32 that's been making me angry because just
00:33:34 as much as i miss comedy i miss
00:33:35 i used to go to my wrestling shows with
00:33:37 my friends and my buddies and
00:33:39 now i'm watching the japanese wrestling
00:33:41 that i love and seeing that they have
00:33:43 full crowds
00:33:44 all sitting there and masks just hanging
00:33:46 out because they
00:33:47 are good at handling their fucking
00:33:49 business
00:33:50 like that's when it because when you're
00:33:52 just sitting here you're like oh well
00:33:53 we're all
00:33:54 falling apart and it's just how it is
00:33:56 but then you start looking over at other
00:33:57 countries and you're like well no they
00:33:59 they figured some shit out well this
00:34:01 virus is so sneaky man
00:34:03 even japan has had a resurgence recently
00:34:06 it's so weird man
00:34:07 it's the weirdest fucking virus it's
00:34:10 just like new zealand even had a
00:34:11 resurgence new zealand had
00:34:12 over a hundred days with zero cases and
00:34:14 then they just got a
00:34:16 they got about i think was was it four
00:34:17 or something like that got it and one
00:34:20 one family got it one trying to figure
00:34:22 out how that happened
00:34:23 so they shut down the city where they're
00:34:25 at sort of like they
00:34:27 stage three or something one family yeah
00:34:30 so one family of four has it
00:34:31 sneaky fucks what have they been up to
00:34:33 maybe they got some bad tests but
00:34:35 probably not trying to trace how it
00:34:37 happened
00:34:39 it's such a weird weird weird disease
00:34:41 man
00:34:42 i know so many people that have gotten
00:34:43 it now i think i know about nine people
00:34:45 and so many of them have different
00:34:47 symptoms i know people that got it and
00:34:49 they just got a mild headache and they
00:34:51 felt like shit for a day
00:34:52 and then they were fine and then i know
00:34:54 other people that like michael yo who's
00:34:55 on death's door
00:34:56 you know but his when people ask me
00:34:58 about that there's extenuating
00:34:59 circumstances like if you listen to
00:35:01 michael's story
00:35:02 he was worn the fuck out flew all the
00:35:04 way to new york did shows
00:35:06 did morning radio did tv flew all the
00:35:09 way
00:35:09 back and then got in a car with his
00:35:11 family drove to vegas hung out with his
00:35:13 wife's mom's family
00:35:15 hung out there for a while and then
00:35:17 drove all the way back home
00:35:18 same day and then had auditions the next
00:35:21 day and then auditions the day after
00:35:22 that and then
00:35:23 boom it hit him his immune system was
00:35:25 compromised yes he was wrecked
00:35:27 who's exhausted and low vitamin d
00:35:29 vitamin d seems to be one of the big
00:35:31 factors
00:35:31 gigantic factor there was a recent study
00:35:34 um that uh dr rhonda patrick sent me
00:35:36 yesterday that i have to go over
00:35:38 but one of the things that she said was
00:35:39 that in a series of studies they did
00:35:42 when they showed people in the icu for
00:35:44 covid more than 80
00:35:45 of them had insufficient levels of
00:35:47 vitamin d
00:35:48 and out of the people that were in
00:35:50 intensive care only four percent
00:35:52 had sufficient levels of vitamin d
00:35:55 goddam vitamin d vitamin d yes i do yeah
00:35:58 how much
00:35:59 man i don't know i just whatever's in
00:36:01 the bottle i'm telling you
00:36:02 one of those things yeah multivitamins
00:36:04 no it's a full weight yeah the d is in
00:36:06 the multi
00:36:07 yeah so the full c then the multi
00:36:10 b something called argonine that i don't
00:36:12 know
00:36:13 it's an amino acid yeah that i do know
00:36:15 that but i don't know what that means
00:36:17 it helps build muscle okay i'm glad i'm
00:36:19 taking it yeah branch chain amino acid
00:36:21 is a really good uh post workout
00:36:23 yeah take it after yeah take it after my
00:36:26 workout but before my
00:36:27 yes what kind of protein drink are you
00:36:30 drinking in that thing what is it uh
00:36:32 this is just like some bullshit this is
00:36:33 like metrics
00:36:34 uh just regular but i'm actually i need
00:36:37 to figure out a better powder because i
00:36:40 don't
00:36:40 i i just got on it and just got the
00:36:43 basic like oh this tastes chocolatey i'm
00:36:44 pretty sure it's not great
00:36:46 but um i'm sure you can tell me some
00:36:48 good yeah i find
00:36:49 hemp to be the best protein powder the
00:36:52 most easily digestible
00:36:54 i have zero problems with it
00:36:55 digestion-wise like if i drink whey
00:36:57 an hour later i gotta stay the fuck away
00:36:59 from people otherwise i'm gonna be
00:37:01 farting
00:37:01 no didn't have a problem with whey but i
00:37:03 always have less of a problem with hemp
00:37:05 that's that's always yeah yeah it's the
00:37:07 most digestible for me i mean
00:37:09 it's just easy it's also something i can
00:37:11 eat literally
00:37:12 i can drink it rather literally an hour
00:37:14 before a workout and have zero problems
00:37:17 just take it with a little bit of
00:37:18 coconut water mix it up
00:37:20 you know it's just simple easy
00:37:24 you know um i use the on it kind but
00:37:26 there's a lot of good
00:37:27 powders out there and it's uh it's very
00:37:30 uh
00:37:30 absorbable it's very very bio-available
00:37:33 form of protein in terms of plant
00:37:35 protein
00:37:36 the two best um i find plant proteins or
00:37:39 p
00:37:39 proteins really good and hemp protein i
00:37:41 think hemp protein is a little better
00:37:43 at least in my experience okay look into
00:37:46 some hemp protein but metrics is
00:37:47 delicious
00:37:48 it is delicious like you're getting
00:37:49 yourself a little shake yeah that's what
00:37:51 i do in the morning when i have my
00:37:53 favorite breakfast i get a rice cake
00:37:54 that has a little bit of almond butter
00:37:56 and a little bit of apple butter and
00:37:58 then i have a shake and i go oh i'm
00:37:59 having shaken cake for breakfast
00:38:01 it's just mental games yeah
00:38:04 [Music]

00:38:07 losing weight how much did you weigh
00:38:09 360. wow

00:38:25 and just keep staying lean and um just
00:38:27 keep
00:38:28 putting on muscle a bit um but yeah i'd
00:38:31 like to lose like another 15 pounds
00:38:32 nice yeah you could do that

00:39:12 it's a whole it's actually it's a whole
00:39:14 complex of shows
00:39:16 where people from other countries meet
00:39:17 people in america and they get married
00:39:19 they have to get married within 90 days
00:39:21 once they move to america
00:39:22 but then also we've been watching the
00:39:23 other way on the recommendation of eric
00:39:26 griffin
00:39:26 where americans moved to other countries
00:39:29 for their significant others and that's
00:39:31 been
00:39:32 insane uh and beautiful it's been
00:39:34 beautiful to watch together
00:39:36 it makes our relationship look so much
00:39:37 stronger
00:39:38 [Laughter]
00:39:41 go baby we never said we had to we
00:39:42 should start over i never had lied to
00:39:44 you about a gambling problem that i had
00:39:47 you know it just makes us look a lot
00:39:50 better when we're watching those
00:39:51 relationships
00:39:52 um and but they're at the airport a lot
00:39:54 and i would go oh that's pdx oh that's
00:39:56 dude
00:39:58 she's just like oh she's like why are
00:39:59 you getting so excited about seeing
00:40:01 these airports and i was just like
00:40:03 i think i just fucking miss the the
00:40:06 whole
00:40:08 process i just miss knowing oh i'm going
00:40:10 to a new city
00:40:12 new people are going to see me i might
00:40:13 meet some new friends like you know
00:40:15 i miss that have you been writing i've
00:40:17 been writing a bit yeah yeah
00:40:20 um go ahead what sorry what's your
00:40:22 process uh
00:40:23 my process is usually from like if we're
00:40:26 talking about from
00:40:26 start um i kind of work on this little
00:40:29 grid
00:40:30 where i just break it down into love
00:40:33 hate and fear
00:40:34 and then i just kind of get stoned or
00:40:38 just sometimes not stoned at all and
00:40:39 i'll just play some instrumental music
00:40:41 and i'll just write about what i'm
00:40:42 scared about what i'm
00:40:44 pissed about what i'm in love with and
00:40:47 then i
00:40:49 didn't take those topics and try to
00:40:51 figure out jokes about what's going on
00:40:52 in my life
00:40:53 that's interesting have you always done
00:40:55 it that way yeah love hate fear
00:40:57 what what uh where'd you get the
00:40:59 inspiration to do it that way i think i
00:41:01 just got it from a
00:41:03 writing workbook from when i was in like
00:41:04 an english class in high school
00:41:06 really yeah it was just about how you
00:41:08 would brainstorm writing
00:41:10 a um paper it's a great idea
00:41:13 yeah i mean it helps me get the basics
00:41:16 down so instead of like oh i'm writing
00:41:17 this joke about this it's like okay
00:41:19 i'm writing about my wife because i
00:41:20 fucking love my wife or i'm writing
00:41:21 about my son or
00:41:23 i'm scared about covid or i'm scared
00:41:25 about this or you know
00:41:26 the more specific i can get about what
00:41:29 exactly i'm
00:41:30 scared of or i'm scared
00:41:33 i'm afraid of uh you know or what i'm
00:41:37 in love with and just the more specific
00:41:39 i can get the better the jokes are
00:41:41 and so it's a lot of work that way and
00:41:42 then sometimes at two in the morning
00:41:44 i'll just be stoned and something will
00:41:45 pop in and i gotta go chase down a
00:41:47 notebook
00:41:48 yeah the stoned ideas that this pop out
00:41:50 of noah are the weirdest ones like what
00:41:52 that's not even my idea that's the
00:41:54 universe yes giving it to you but i
00:41:56 usually find that they it doesn't give
00:41:58 it to me if i haven't put in that
00:42:00 earlier work right right yeah it'll give
00:42:03 me a gift for
00:42:04 putting in the the shitty work of trying
00:42:07 to figure out this how the fuck am i
00:42:08 gonna break this down
00:42:10 and then in the middle of the night some
00:42:12 completely joke
00:42:13 some other other left field joke will
00:42:15 just pop in and it'll be fully formed
00:42:17 set up punchline
00:42:18 everything yeah and i'm just like i was
00:42:20 just always i'm just like
00:42:21 thank you yeah it is crazy like that
00:42:24 right
00:42:24 it is crazy that that's that put in the
00:42:27 work part is uh what pres you ever read
00:42:29 steven pressfield's the war of art
00:42:31 it's a great book a real small book too
00:42:33 it's i used to i buy stacks of them
00:42:35 in the old studio and i just hand them
00:42:37 out to guests like especially comics i'm
00:42:39 like
00:42:40 trust me just read this because uh one
00:42:42 of the things it's about is about
00:42:44 establishing the
00:42:45 the laws of your work like the way you
00:42:47 were you you're a professional
00:42:49 and you show up every day as a
00:42:51 professional and you sit in front of
00:42:52 that computer or that notebook
00:42:54 and you call upon the muse you know and
00:42:57 whether or not the muse
00:42:58 is real the if you do the work
00:43:01 it it it acts as if it's real yeah
00:43:04 i agree yeah i believe with that all the
00:43:06 time yeah
00:43:08 um i've been talking to myself lately
00:43:10 just like then that's what's been
00:43:11 keeping me with my health and my writing
00:43:13 and
00:43:14 my meditating and whatever it's just
00:43:16 like figuring out who i am and what
00:43:18 works for me
00:43:19 and then being like you follow those
00:43:22 fucking rules
00:43:23 don't break your rules yeah whenever you
00:43:25 break your rules
00:43:27 shit doesn't go right even though it
00:43:29 might look cool it might look amazing it
00:43:31 might be like oh well this time if i
00:43:32 break my rule
00:43:33 it's fucking it looks like it's going to
00:43:35 be a dope and i'll get a bunch of money
00:43:37 never works out so just don't break your
00:43:40 fucking rules
00:43:41 yeah and and i'm just it's still it's
00:43:44 hard
00:43:44 but i'm i've been working on that she's
00:43:46 like oh i got to eat well
00:43:48 i got to work out i trust my intuition
00:43:51 i'm the leader i'm the fucking boss i
00:43:53 don't let other people
00:43:55 lead me i i lead even if i don't know
00:43:58 where i'm fucking going
00:43:59 i lead and i just follow those rules
00:44:03 have you had that issue with like
00:44:04 representation like agents or managers
00:44:07 trying to tell you what to do or
00:44:08 guide you into a way that you didn't
00:44:10 think was you oh no
00:44:12 no not for me i i've been truly blessed
00:44:14 in that
00:44:15 truly but i think i have like one of the
00:44:17 best managers in
00:44:18 in the fucking world like she she's
00:44:20 amazing she's um
00:44:22 married to the game she's um my name's
00:44:24 melanie but
00:44:25 truett brian possain's wife and she's
00:44:28 been
00:44:28 my manager since before i moved out of
00:44:31 la like she paid my fucking rent when i
00:44:34 couldn't afford to pay my rent like
00:44:35 she's looked out for me
00:44:37 every step of the way that's awesome
00:44:39 she's take there's been
00:44:40 there's been fucking like this show is
00:44:43 going to series
00:44:44 they are making an offer on you this
00:44:47 will give you a bunch of money
00:44:49 but it's not the right project let's
00:44:50 fucking pass wow
00:44:53 you know and that was like in the past
00:44:56 and
00:44:56 i mean that happened a couple of weeks
00:44:58 into covet we were both scared shitless
00:45:00 i know she was scared shitless about
00:45:02 that ten percent
00:45:04 a guaranteed season yeah and she was
00:45:07 like
00:45:08 no this isn't she's like this was she's
00:45:10 like you've already done
00:45:11 parts like this three or four times you
00:45:13 you you can do this this will be there
00:45:15 for you we're shooting for bigger things
00:45:17 for you
00:45:18 and just like her belief in me and and
00:45:21 drive for me have always been there like
00:45:23 i never ever feel like she's
00:45:25 ever sold me short so that she can get a
00:45:27 check ever
00:45:28 that's huge that's huge it's rare yeah i
00:45:31 do
00:45:32 i do know that i have many friends that
00:45:34 have really bad managers that give them
00:45:35 terrible advice
00:45:36 to take projects that are just
00:45:38 short-term financial gain for
00:45:40 the sacrifice of long-term career
00:45:42 options oh
00:45:43 my manager if she sees the word
00:45:45 exclusive in any contract she's just
00:45:47 like
00:45:47 we ain't fucking with them
00:45:49 [Laughter]
00:45:51 you are not exclusive to anybody you are
00:45:53 dating around
00:45:54 [Laughter]
00:45:56 that's great that's that's great
00:45:58 attitude man that's what's interesting
00:46:00 about today's climate it's like you
00:46:02 don't get a lot of real
00:46:04 managers anymore you almost get you
00:46:06 almost have like
00:46:07 comics you have two agents you have your
00:46:10 agent agent and then you have your
00:46:11 manager who's kind of acting as an agent
00:46:13 instead of acting as a manager because
00:46:14 they're all desperado
00:46:15 or maybe they don't really have faith in
00:46:18 you so they just want that money
00:46:21 they don't really think that you're
00:46:22 going to be that person who has a long
00:46:25 career or
00:46:26 that you could keep accelerating and
00:46:28 they don't believe in the development
00:46:29 yes yeah yeah i feel like yeah my
00:46:32 manager's always been there
00:46:33 she's always kind of seen me two years
00:46:36 ahead of where i've been at like i'm
00:46:39 i have that story about recently but i
00:46:40 remember when i first was in portland
00:46:42 and there's this commercial that reached
00:46:44 out to me and they wanted me to play a
00:46:45 roach in a fucking bug spray commercial
00:46:48 and i was broke as fuck and she was just
00:46:51 like no
00:46:51 she's like because we don't know what
00:46:53 you're gonna be in the next couple years
00:46:55 and that commercial could be around
00:46:56 forever
00:46:57 smart woman and so if you need the money
00:46:59 that bad i'd rather just give you the
00:47:01 money
00:47:03 wow good for her man yeah she's dope and
00:47:06 i have many friends who like
00:47:07 they just are tremendous tremendous
00:47:09 comedians tremendous joke writers
00:47:11 one friend who comes to mind immediately
00:47:13 and i've always told him i was like
00:47:15 you need to you need to dump your
00:47:16 manager and get a better manager because
00:47:18 you're doing
00:47:19 you're doing your part and i don't see
00:47:22 why you're not getting more money you're
00:47:23 not getting
00:47:24 more chances you're not advancing at
00:47:26 things they're not putting you on these
00:47:27 talking head shows
00:47:29 like you're doing your part and i don't
00:47:32 you're fucking like you know he opened
00:47:34 for me once i was like dude you're
00:47:35 fucking
00:47:35 you're crushing me and i'm the one
00:47:38 getting the bigger check like what the
00:47:39 fuck is that like
00:47:40 get your get your business in order and
00:47:43 i've always
00:47:44 um i think from having a kid i've always
00:47:47 been very much into the art
00:47:49 and very much into the business yeah
00:47:51 it's just it's hard for people to find
00:47:53 someone like your manager that
00:47:54 that is dedicated i got real lucky i
00:47:56 found mine when i was an open miker
00:47:59 i've been with the same manager since
00:48:02 1991 or some shit
00:48:05 something crazy like that yeah that's
00:48:07 insane yeah i was like three years into
00:48:09 comedy when i met him
00:48:10 and i've been with him and then he's
00:48:12 basically
00:48:13 not not retired but he steps back and
00:48:15 then my manager
00:48:17 chandra she took over 10 plus years ago
00:48:21 or more might be more than 10 years ago
00:48:23 now and uh
00:48:25 they're just the best in terms of
00:48:28 like seeing the big picture and the same
00:48:31 thing you're saying about your manager
00:48:32 just looking at the business in terms of
00:48:35 like
00:48:35 where do you what do you really want to
00:48:37 do like what's going to make you happy
00:48:39 like there's things you can do for money
00:48:41 but what's
00:48:42 what are you here for yeah like what do
00:48:44 you want you want
00:48:45 you want to like walk away from
00:48:47 everything you do
00:48:48 going that was great i enjoyed that
00:48:50 that's what i wanted to do like a
00:48:51 special
00:48:52 thank you good night you want to go we
00:48:54 did it we nailed it high fives all
00:48:55 around
00:48:56 that's how you want to be able to
00:48:58 achieve those moments and get those
00:48:59 feelings
00:49:00 i think i know this is unrelatable to
00:49:02 some people that are listening to this
00:49:04 but i think that way
00:49:05 with everything and maybe you don't have
00:49:07 a manager for whatever your goal is in
00:49:09 life
00:49:10 but you kind of have to think about it
00:49:11 as your own manager you got to think
00:49:14 like what do i really want to do and
00:49:17 are the steps that i'm taking or the
00:49:19 things that i'm doing right now are they
00:49:20 moving me
00:49:21 closer to that and if not what the fuck
00:49:25 do i have to do different than what i'm
00:49:26 doing
00:49:27 yeah i mean to me that's i have that
00:49:29 manager i also have my vision board i
00:49:31 have my shit that i do on my own
00:49:33 yeah vision board oh yes joe what's up
00:49:36 top of the
00:49:37 vision board what's on my show getting
00:49:39 my own fucking show about
00:49:40 my son being a single dad of a son with
00:49:42 autism making it a fucking dope ass
00:49:45 comedy
00:49:46 what's what netflix should do that that
00:49:48 sounds like a perfect thing you would
00:49:49 think
00:49:50 [Laughter]
00:49:53 that seems like a really good idea for a
00:49:55 show i think so we found a spot we're
00:49:57 working on it
00:49:58 okay all right you got to keep mom we'll
00:50:00 talk later
00:50:02 there's that just more um i want to be a
00:50:05 lead in some movies i want to do
00:50:07 more i always see myself as like this
00:50:09 rick morana's
00:50:10 billy crystal type of unconventional
00:50:12 charming leading man and i just need a
00:50:14 buddy

00:50:22 played off of each other
00:50:23 you need a buddy i do need a butt who
00:50:25 would your buddy be i gotta think about
00:50:27 that
00:50:27 think about that that would be think

00:50:30 bobby lee well he seems crazy for him
00:50:32 he's crazy as fuck
00:50:35 it might be a problem if he gets too
00:50:37 successful he might sabotage go back on
00:50:39 pills
00:50:42 bobby lee's so wild he's so wild
00:50:45 he truly i did bobby lee in the early
00:50:48 days when he'd like bring a knife to
00:50:49 work

00:51:04 whole time trying to convince me and he
00:51:05 halfway does
00:51:06 and then i just go sit down somewhere
00:51:08 else and i go oh
00:51:10 he's a fucking high school bully like
00:51:12 guys

00:51:28 who fucks with you all the time and i
00:51:30 was like
00:51:31 and see money no money nothing like he
00:51:34 just
00:51:34 is that's who he is yeah and i love it
00:51:37 yeah
00:51:38 he's a guy who needs a goddamn special
00:51:40 i've been yelling at him forever now he
00:51:41 has an excuse
00:51:44 there's no comedy you know now he's got
00:51:47 an excuse but bobby lee
00:51:48 is absolutely the best stand-up comic
00:51:51 that does not have a special
00:51:52 i mean he is as legit a headliner as
00:51:56 has ever lived when that guy is crushing
00:51:58 when he's in the
00:51:59 the or crushing you like the fact that
00:52:01 he doesn't have a special is
00:52:03 criminal criminal yeah bobby's the fuck
00:52:06 i mean he's just unique it's just him
00:52:09 and
00:52:09 that that's to me is the definition of
00:52:11 someone you want to give a special to
00:52:12 yeah i've known that dude forever
00:52:15 known him for a long time back when he
00:52:17 was crazy but it's nice to see that he's
00:52:19 gotten his shit together he's calmer and
00:52:22 more stable doesn't rub his balls on you
00:52:25 as much
00:52:25 not as much but not nearly as much yeah
00:52:28 i got a picture of him
00:52:29 standing in the middle of the hallway
00:52:32 with his pants down
00:52:33 and his dick tucked in between his legs
00:52:36 it's like
00:52:37 like that's bobby lee
00:52:40 we've all seen this you said you
00:52:44 meditate
00:52:45 yeah like what do you do you know
00:52:47 nothing like
00:52:48 you know nothing special just sit around
00:52:50 doing 10 minute little meditation and
00:52:52 when i get up in the morning
00:52:54 sometimes they're guided some a lot of
00:52:56 times they're not
00:52:57 but i talked to i don't know you know
00:52:58 who donald kerry is he's a writer he's a
00:53:01 tremendous writer wrote for the simpsons
00:53:03 wrote for letterman
00:53:04 and he came on my podcast and he just
00:53:06 told me about this
00:53:07 thing that he was doing this acronym
00:53:09 that he was doing every day mr always
00:53:11 just meditate read art right exercise
00:53:14 every day that was like part of his
00:53:15 rules and so i was like oh i'm gonna
00:53:18 try to adapt that into my rules just as
00:53:21 a way to keep that going so
00:53:22 that's part of what i do meditate read
00:53:24 art right exercise every day that's
00:53:26 awesome
00:53:27 yeah i mean that's a beautiful thing if
00:53:29 you could structure your life like that
00:53:31 and make sure you follow those
00:53:32 principles you'll get you'll just get
00:53:34 more out of your brain
00:53:35 yeah and then you're surprised about
00:53:37 like for all the times you're bored and
00:53:38 you're like oh there's too many
00:53:40 hours in a day you're like if you got to
00:53:41 go through all those fucking things
00:53:43 you'll be like fuck half the day's gone
00:53:44 yeah i don't understand people that say
00:53:47 there's too many hours in a day
00:53:48 like what are you doing like i want a
00:53:51 hundred lives
00:53:52 i wanna live a hundred separate lives so
00:53:55 i could just do
00:53:55 different i would i i literally don't do
00:53:58 things because i'm scared i'll get too
00:54:00 into them
00:54:01 and then i will have less time for all
00:54:04 the other shit that i'm already obsessed
00:54:05 with i'm the same way i i
00:54:07 mull over the decision for an extended
00:54:09 period of time because i know
00:54:11 once i make the decision i'm all in and
00:54:14 that was like you know i started playing
00:54:15 video games on twitch and doing these
00:54:17 little comedy nights on twitch where i
00:54:18 show old videos and make fun of people
00:54:20 because that's part of things that i
00:54:21 missed was that
00:54:22 not just watching comedy i always i miss
00:54:25 it being in the back of the room
00:54:26 making fun of this punch line or this
00:54:28 tag
00:54:30 and then being like oh that's good you
00:54:31 know i missed that so i've been doing
00:54:33 that on twitch and playing games with
00:54:34 people
00:54:35 and but it took me a long time to decide
00:54:36 to do because i was like oh once i do it
00:54:38 i'm
00:54:39 anything i'm stand up acting whatever
00:54:42 if i choose to do it i go full force
00:54:45 yeah you get into it right
00:54:46 yeah and then it becomes a part of your
00:54:48 daily routine and then you're trying to
00:54:49 get better at it
00:54:50 yeah podcasting yeah man you the twitch
00:54:53 thing
00:54:54 thing seems like you could eat up a lot
00:54:57 of your day
00:54:58 just fucking around on twitch you can do
00:55:00 you have a good chair that supports your
00:55:02 backpack
00:55:02 solid chair i could use a better chair i
00:55:04 could definitely turn it into
00:55:06 did you like that one it's pretty nice
00:55:07 very good yes i like these
00:55:10 good for the back yeah ergonomic you
00:55:12 need something ergonomic
00:55:13 yeah you don't want to develop back
00:55:15 problems because
00:55:17 you know no like all the people that are
00:55:19 just sitting down all the time
00:55:20 yeah well that's why again the two two
00:55:22 treads of the day just make sure
00:55:24 keeping myself upright moving so when
00:55:26 you do this meditating thing
00:55:28 you do it every day ten minutes you
00:55:30 start your day this way do you go to a
00:55:32 place like
00:55:32 quiet place in your house where no one's
00:55:34 around i usually do it right there in
00:55:35 bed
00:55:36 make up the bed get everything together
00:55:39 sit there
00:55:39 meditate for 10 minutes usually try to
00:55:42 do it before my son wakes up before the
00:55:43 neighbors wake up
00:55:44 because their family doesn't seem to be
00:55:46 as structurally strong as ours
00:55:47 [Laughter]
00:55:50 oh you got wacky neighbors and they they
00:55:52 like yelling at each other

00:57:28 always look back on the time you got
00:57:29 married you go damn we got married
00:57:30 during one of the weirdest times in the
00:57:32 history of the united states
00:57:33 yeah man leaning into what's solid when
00:57:35 shit's all falling apart that was
00:57:36 actually
00:57:37 like we got engaged before it of course
00:57:39 but
00:57:40 i was like oh i'm pretty sure i was a
00:57:42 little gun-shy because i've been i got
00:57:43 married when i was in my 20s and
00:57:45 obviously that didn't work out too well
00:57:47 and i had my son and and i remember
00:57:48 leaving my home there and i was like
00:57:50 this will never happen again i will you
00:57:52 know and it still will never happen
00:57:53 again
00:57:54 but um i was still a little gun shy but
00:57:56 cause i was like oh we're
00:57:58 in the good times we go to nice we go to
00:58:00 fucking
00:58:02 wherever and sure we'd hang out at home
00:58:03 or we just should go
00:58:05 on set with me and some indie movie in
00:58:06 oklahoma and we still have fun
00:58:08 and so i knew she was a good woman i
00:58:10 knew that i could trust her but it
00:58:12 especially when the shit goes down and
00:58:14 everything's going back and she's out
00:58:16 there like okay well what do we do what
00:58:17 we need to
00:58:18 pull back on what can we you know
00:58:20 purchase less of and and then i thought
00:58:22 i might have to go
00:58:23 out of the country for this role for a
00:58:25 few months and i was like oh shit i'll
00:58:27 leave my son with her and i had
00:58:29 no worry and i was like even
00:58:32 you know when he was with his mom i
00:58:34 would be worried
00:58:35 you know but with her i know she's got
00:58:38 him i know she loves them i know
00:58:40 she's got his best interest at her and i
00:58:41 was that really was when it clicked in
00:58:43 and i was like oh this is my wife like
00:58:45 this is my person that's beautiful i
00:58:48 love stories like that
00:58:49 thank you that's amazing congratulations
00:58:51 yeah she's special she's a special
00:58:53 pirate
00:58:53 i think because she's a little
00:58:55 small-town canadian lady so
00:58:57 she doesn't know how hot she is you know
00:58:59 yeah
00:58:59 [Laughter]
00:59:01 that could be a problem here yeah yeah
00:59:03 oh she's figuring it out
00:59:06 she figured it out a lot of guys you
00:59:08 know try to hit on her
00:59:09 every fucking day but i'm not worried
00:59:13 good for you good for you i wonder when
00:59:16 this is gonna end
00:59:18 the the lockdown when are we gonna get
00:59:20 back to normal are you gonna be one of
00:59:22 the first in line for a vaccine
00:59:23 are you gonna wait it out i gotta wait
00:59:25 in the middle i gotta be somewhere in
00:59:27 the middle
00:59:27 as a parent of a child with autism
00:59:30 vaccine and scare me in
00:59:31 in some ways but it's still obviously do
00:59:34 you think that vaccines cause autism i
00:59:36 don't believe they cause autism i
00:59:38 believe they can
00:59:39 accelerate certain things and people who
00:59:42 maybe are predisposed to
00:59:43 um to having to to having it
00:59:47 i and i can only just tell you my i will
00:59:49 tell you a personal story and people can
00:59:51 choose to
00:59:52 like it or not um but i just remember
00:59:55 the day
00:59:56 that we got my son his first vaccine
00:59:58 vaccinations and
00:59:59 he had been developing normally and just
01:00:01 been chill and been talking and doing
01:00:03 all the things
01:00:04 pretty normally and then we got him the
01:00:06 vaccine and me and my ex-wife and we
01:00:08 just remember he just kind of like
01:00:10 was out of it and we even because me and
01:00:12 my ex-wife were big potheads we were
01:00:14 both like oh he's
01:00:15 look how stoned he looks look how
01:00:16 fucking he looks so stoned
01:00:18 and he's out of it but he fucking never
01:00:20 came back
01:00:22 and so that was a moment where i was
01:00:24 like
01:00:25 you know i was like i don't know if it
01:00:26 caused it or that but i was like this
01:00:28 is that's the story i can tell you
01:00:31 wow it's not the first time i've heard
01:00:34 that
01:00:36 you know i have uh a friend
01:00:39 my friend johnny in a very similar
01:00:41 situation
01:00:43 i don't yeah i don't know i know how
01:00:46 adamant the people that make vaccines
01:00:49 are that vaccines don't cause autism
01:00:51 and i know it's a fiercely debated issue
01:00:54 and
01:00:54 in fact dr peter hotez who is an expert
01:00:57 in vaccines who actually has an autistic
01:00:59 daughter
01:01:00 is adamant about the fact that there's
01:01:04 apparently um different environmental
01:01:07 factors that contribute to autism
01:01:09 and they think it all of it takes place
01:01:11 during the womb
01:01:13 but i don't know there's yeah i'm not
01:01:15 getting
01:01:16 i can never be like well vaccine gave my
01:01:18 son autism i would never
01:01:20 say that but i will just tell you that
01:01:22 story yeah
01:01:24 the the thing is if that story
01:01:28 if that was the case
01:01:31 how much do you think would ever get out
01:01:34 that all these people who have this
01:01:37 similar story
01:01:38 all have a case against the
01:01:40 pharmaceutical companies
01:01:42 i mean do you just just wrap your
01:01:45 mind around the legal troubles and i'm
01:01:48 not saying that vaccines cause autism
01:01:50 what i am saying is if
01:01:52 they did there would most certainly be
01:01:55 an effort to conceal that
01:01:56 yeah absolutely most certainly
01:01:59 absolutely
01:02:00 that would be uh that would be a crazy
01:02:04 lawsuit because i mean how many children
01:02:06 are autistic in this country do you know
01:02:08 i don't know
01:02:09 but no it's a it's a lot it's a lot and
01:02:12 the question is
01:02:13 the question has always been are there
01:02:15 more now
01:02:16 because fathers are older mothers or
01:02:19 older
01:02:20 environmental factors or that we're
01:02:22 diagnosing it now
01:02:24 we didn't diagnose it before we didn't
01:02:25 understand it before i mean the first
01:02:27 time i even heard of autism was rain man
01:02:30 remember the dustin hoffman movie that
01:02:32 was the first time i ever heard about i
01:02:33 didn't even know what it was
01:02:35 i never met anybody who had autism so i
01:02:37 saw that i was like huh
01:02:38 what's going on there yeah same
01:02:41 same to me i never thought about it
01:02:43 never had any
01:02:45 second thought about it at all and until
01:02:48 my son was diagnosed and then had to
01:02:51 become much more aware about it and and
01:02:54 it's still a thing that um i get hit
01:02:56 with
01:02:57 because i'll i'm just a dummy because
01:02:58 i'll be like okay my son's got his high
01:03:00 school he's doing well and
01:03:02 he's going to his classes and then they
01:03:04 had to actually sit there and go like
01:03:05 okay you know he's getting a certificate
01:03:06 but you know this isn't a real
01:03:09 he's not a real high school graduate and
01:03:11 i'm like oh
01:03:13 what you know i know he's a high school
01:03:15 graduate i want my son to go to college
01:03:17 and then i have to sit back and go like
01:03:19 oh wait fuck i have
01:03:21 a we have a different road we have a
01:03:22 different life and actually
01:03:24 this lockdown and everything has really
01:03:26 been helpful in going through that
01:03:28 just being like well everything's
01:03:29 fucking weird and different and
01:03:31 um because i've always been like well no
01:03:33 matter what i'm gonna pick my son wants
01:03:34 to go to ucla
01:03:35 so i'll pay to go to him to go to ucla
01:03:37 even if it's just life classes
01:03:38 or whatever but um now i've been
01:03:41 thinking about more like okay let's just
01:03:43 figure out a way
01:03:44 for him to be more independent um on his
01:03:47 own
01:03:47 physically financially whatever he can
01:03:50 do
01:03:50 he might not go to college he might go
01:03:53 to college
01:03:54 but you know again if i make my show i'm
01:03:56 like well he's got to be a consultant on
01:03:57 this show
01:03:58 he's got to do this he's gonna do that i
01:04:00 just want him
01:04:02 to um have a good life basically of
01:04:04 course
01:04:06 is there anything that helps him like
01:04:08 does anything um
01:04:10 alleviate some of his symptoms i mean
01:04:14 just the constant therapies that he's
01:04:16 been in he like he's been that
01:04:18 he's diagnosed when he's two 17 now so
01:04:20 he's been in school
01:04:22 since he was two just doing different
01:04:25 you know from
01:04:26 pre-kindergarten therapies to voice
01:04:29 um voice therapy and i just think it's
01:04:32 been that constant right now he's
01:04:33 getting a lot of social
01:04:35 skills therapy where we he was before
01:04:37 everything got locked down
01:04:39 he was doing this thing called the
01:04:40 miracle project which is awesome they
01:04:42 just take
01:04:43 kids from with different backgrounds and
01:04:47 teach them social skills take them on
01:04:48 different outings and my son was doing a
01:04:50 play
01:04:52 which unfortunately got cancelled
01:04:53 because of it but they sent us a tape of
01:04:55 the rehearsal and it fucking
01:04:56 it was dope because it was the day i got
01:04:58 um i found out i wasn't getting this
01:05:00 role and i was real
01:05:01 upset it was on my vision board of like
01:05:03 i want to fucking get this role
01:05:05 and i didn't get it and i was pissed off
01:05:06 and doing the same thing like fuck
01:05:08 hollywood they don't understand they
01:05:09 don't understand
01:05:10 how good i am and then i just watch my
01:05:12 son and all these other autistic
01:05:14 teenagers
01:05:15 do this their own production of a play
01:05:18 it's the silliest thing i've ever seen
01:05:19 my son is singing the spongebob theme
01:05:22 song
01:05:22 another kid is singing a drake song and
01:05:25 just
01:05:26 seeing them go from being these awkward
01:05:28 in their shell
01:05:29 not you know looking down looking at the
01:05:31 floor and then
01:05:32 the moment that they're actually
01:05:34 interested in something when you know
01:05:35 when my son hears this song play or
01:05:38 or they know it's their turn to say
01:05:40 they're lying them
01:05:42 light up and fucking just nail their
01:05:44 line and
01:05:45 be fucking great at it and i was like
01:05:46 man that's what art is that's what
01:05:48 fucking
01:05:49 that's what i love is i don't give a
01:05:51 shit about money about it i mean it's
01:05:53 nice to pay my bills but
01:05:55 i like this feeling that i get from it
01:05:57 and and of watching my son
01:05:59 get to do it and it just makes me feel
01:06:01 good i'm sorry this is rambly ass story
01:06:03 no no
01:06:04 no that's not brambly at all man you're
01:06:06 expressing yourself that's not rambly at
01:06:07 all
01:06:08 yeah i mean sometimes you need to be
01:06:12 exposed to different things just to put
01:06:13 it into perspective
01:06:15 which is how fortunate we are and how
01:06:17 fortunate
01:06:18 you know how easy we really do have it
01:06:21 how good we really have it and sometimes
01:06:23 you know when you have
01:06:24 ambitious goals and you you have you
01:06:26 know your eyes are on the prize you got
01:06:28 a vision board and you're like fuck
01:06:29 why isn't this happening for me
01:06:31 sometimes you gotta see some struggle
01:06:33 you gotta see people that just aren't
01:06:34 doing that well to realize like oh
01:06:37 i'm all right yeah yeah yeah yeah i've
01:06:40 been
01:06:41 made very well aware that i'm fucking
01:06:44 doing extremely well
01:06:45 extremely that's one of the best things
01:06:47 i think uh
01:06:48 about covid initially i mean it just
01:06:51 took too long
01:06:52 it's been too fucked up now but
01:06:54 initially i felt like
01:06:56 one of the good aspects of having this
01:06:58 thing where you're forced to stay home
01:07:00 and everybody's worried about a disease
01:07:03 is like you you realize like hey
01:07:04 family friends loved ones this is what's
01:07:07 important
01:07:08 all this other bullshit is like when
01:07:10 when the world is falling apart
01:07:12 the love that you have for your family
01:07:14 and your friends that's what's important
01:07:17 yeah yeah it felt good like that for a
01:07:20 couple of weeks and then
01:07:21 everybody felt like they started tearing
01:07:23 at each other they got scared
01:07:25 yeah yeah i mean god social media is so
01:07:28 fucking terrifying now
01:07:29 just dive into this this pit of animals
01:07:32 eating each other it's like
01:07:34 everyone's so angry there's so much
01:07:36 anger and then also
01:07:37 it's like the worst timing ever right
01:07:39 trump and then
01:07:41 the the fucking elections are coming so
01:07:43 there's all this chaos and
01:07:46 joe biden can't talk and the the fucking
01:07:48 you know
01:07:49 in november's around the corner it's
01:07:51 like oh my god
01:07:52 and then everything's still locked up
01:07:54 and it's like oh my god and
01:07:56 they're talking about dropping down the
01:07:58 unemployment check to 400 bucks instead
01:08:00 of 600 and then
01:08:01 they want the states to pay 25 the
01:08:03 state's like we don't have the fucking
01:08:05 money like oh
01:08:06 jesus yeah it's fucking nuts
01:08:09 it's fucking nuts and but then you know
01:08:11 it's overwhelming until you just go to
01:08:13 the basics of it
01:08:14 that's something i always believe from
01:08:16 when i was very young and i think it's
01:08:17 something that's a young
01:08:18 african-american man
01:08:19 pretty early where you just go nobody's
01:08:22 got my fucking back
01:08:23 i gotta take care of me yeah no one's
01:08:25 got my fucking back the government does
01:08:27 not have our backs not at all
01:08:28 it's not possible we have one bit
01:08:31 grossly
01:08:32 overestimated their ability to actually
01:08:34 like manage something like this
01:08:36 yeah which isn't in turn why like i've
01:08:39 seen
01:08:40 what we see in that social media of us
01:08:42 eating each other and going at each
01:08:44 other especially anyone of
01:08:45 that is considered of any stature i mean
01:08:47 i see it happen to you all the time
01:08:49 right with people coming at you for one
01:08:50 thing or another
01:08:52 and i laugh about it because i'm just
01:08:54 like it's just fucking
01:08:55 joe the fuck who cares if he doesn't
01:08:57 like video games who gives a
01:08:59 fuck like i don't care the problem is
01:09:02 they didn't even listen to what i said
01:09:03 yeah
01:09:03 you took a chunk of what i said and took
01:09:05 it out of context i love video games
01:09:07 that's the problem
01:09:08 yeah yeah right quaker
01:09:11 yeah and i even talked about in that
01:09:13 same clip
01:09:15 and we wound up putting the full version
01:09:17 of it online because someone had taken
01:09:18 like
01:09:18 a 50-second chunk of it but i even
01:09:20 talked about those people that do make a
01:09:22 living on it a lot of money
01:09:23 there are people that do it yeah but i'm
01:09:25 saying for a lot of people
01:09:27 that waste if you want to do something
01:09:29 else like if you're trying to do
01:09:30 something with your life
01:09:32 you can find things that will waste all
01:09:34 of your time
01:09:36 and that's one of them yeah well i mean
01:09:39 i like streaming and i like playing
01:09:41 games but it's also the reason why i do
01:09:42 the comedy and i do other things is
01:09:44 because
01:09:45 i think at the very base of it there's
01:09:48 there's no stability of trying to make
01:09:51 your living off of someone else's
01:09:52 product right you're playing someone
01:09:54 else's game you're doing something
01:09:55 it's not yours you know so at any moment
01:09:58 that can be taken away from you
01:10:00 and so that on that small level is what
01:10:03 i i believe in
01:10:04 what you were saying completely but i
01:10:07 think the reason why people
01:10:08 attack so much is because the people who
01:10:11 we're told are like
01:10:12 supposed to be our leaders are obviously
01:10:13 not and people are just looking for
01:10:15 leaders so if you have a big platform
01:10:17 they're just like oh you're a leader
01:10:18 you're you know and then i had people do
01:10:20 that to me i was um
01:10:22 when when the whole george florida thing
01:10:25 was happening and brianna taylor was
01:10:26 happening some
01:10:27 one guy in particular just kept dming me
01:10:30 and being like
01:10:31 when are you going to talk about it when
01:10:32 are you going to talk about it when are
01:10:34 you going to make a post about it
01:10:35 and what he didn't know as i was going
01:10:36 through my own personal shit a friend of
01:10:38 mine had committed suicide
01:10:39 that very weak in a home that i had
01:10:41 lived in three years prior and i was
01:10:44 fucking dealing with that and dealing
01:10:47 with my own life
01:10:48 and so i was like you know who gives a
01:10:50 fuck when i talk about anything like
01:10:52 and i have no obligation i have no
01:10:54 obligation and so it pissed me off
01:10:56 but then i thought about it and i go oh
01:10:58 he's not fucking mad at me
01:11:00 you give a shit about me he's scared
01:11:03 yeah scared shitless
01:11:04 and he's looking for someone to lead him
01:11:06 and he was hoping it would be me
01:11:08 but there's also people look for an
01:11:10 opportunity to get upset at you for
01:11:12 not complying like that there's a
01:11:14 narrative where you're supposed to
01:11:15 be discussing whatever's in the news
01:11:18 whatever is going on you
01:11:19 there's a narrative that you are you
01:11:21 know you're a person who talks
01:11:23 so you should be discussing these things
01:11:24 yeah you're a public figure
01:11:26 so you should you should lend your voice
01:11:28 because they think you should this is
01:11:29 the dumbest fucking thing ever because
01:11:31 you're just like well
01:11:32 how do you assume i think about black
01:11:34 lives matter i'm a black man
01:11:35 i would like my life to matter so if it
01:11:38 makes
01:11:39 why do i gotta go around talking about
01:11:40 it for fucking all day you know it makes
01:11:42 that's gumming up the works takes up too
01:11:44 much fucking time i i agree with that
01:11:46 completely
01:11:46 you should be able to talk about
01:11:47 whatever you want one of my favorite
01:11:49 follows on instagram is little duval
01:11:52 oh yeah and little duvall through all
01:11:54 this craziness he's just
01:11:56 maintaining being little duval and
01:11:58 having fun that sounds like him
01:11:59 always always always lighthearted having
01:12:02 a good time always laughing
01:12:04 his his instagram is like one of the
01:12:06 most consistently happy
01:12:08 thing and like that shows his character
01:12:09 like through all this he's maintained
01:12:12 his
01:12:12 sense of humor and his perspective yeah
01:12:15 that's
01:12:15 power that's power why would you ever
01:12:17 let someone take that away from you
01:12:20 we're here to have fun we're here to
01:12:21 have a good time so
01:12:23 no matter what the circumstances i'm
01:12:24 gonna have a fucking good time i learned
01:12:26 that in my sets long ago when i
01:12:28 when i was like well you guys might not
01:12:30 have a good time tonight
01:12:32 but i will
01:12:33 [Laughter]
01:12:35 yeah sometimes you have to right you
01:12:37 have to go internal
01:12:38 i am really interested to see like how
01:12:42 we recover from this
01:12:43 i'm really interested to see because
01:12:44 we're in such uncharted territory
01:12:47 this is uh this is new waters and it
01:12:49 could go good or it could go bad i mean
01:12:52 every single republic every single
01:12:54 empire that has existed before the
01:12:55 united states has crumbled
01:12:56 all of them they all crumble eventually
01:12:59 my
01:12:59 my fear is the ones that are strong why
01:13:02 we are
01:13:03 falling apart are dangerous they're
01:13:05 dangerous societies
01:13:06 that are dictatorships like china
01:13:10 if china somehow or another becomes the
01:13:12 way they're controlling hong kong
01:13:14 controls the united states we got real
01:13:17 fucking problems on our hands
01:13:18 yeah now i don't know if that's really
01:13:19 possible if this is just like some
01:13:22 fear we say bits of it all the time
01:13:24 right yeah
01:13:25 in business you see the way that um what
01:13:28 these
01:13:28 so-called independent enterprises refuse
01:13:31 to speak on certain things
01:13:33 because there's just so much money
01:13:35 involved you know
01:13:36 when i get to that point you are owned
01:13:38 yes did you ever see that thing where
01:13:40 the world health organization guy won't
01:13:41 talk about taiwan
01:13:42 i won't even mention taiwan he's in an
01:13:44 interview because taiwan
01:13:45 china does not recognize taiwan they
01:13:47 believe taiwan is a part of china and
01:13:49 taiwan thinks it's independent
01:13:50 so the woman interviewer was asking this
01:13:52 guy who works for the world health
01:13:53 organization
01:13:55 taiwan has done a wonderful job of
01:13:56 handling this and he's like
01:14:00 click he just disconnects and then he
01:14:02 comes back like you could see him reach
01:14:04 over
01:14:05 and disconnect it she goes we seem to
01:14:06 have disconnected he goes but now we're
01:14:08 back so
01:14:09 what i was saying was that china well um
01:14:12 china has done a wonderful job uh you
01:14:14 know there's no no need to talk about
01:14:15 that any further so let's keep going
01:14:16 so he would not even say the word taiwan
01:14:20 and like this is the world health
01:14:21 organization like you won't you won't
01:14:23 say the name of an actual country
01:14:27 like really that that's bananas like i
01:14:30 can't trust you
01:14:31 [Laughter]
01:14:32 no yeah you won't even say taiwan what
01:14:34 the fuck else won't you say
01:14:36 you know i mean there's there's been a
01:14:37 few of those things man well you see
01:14:39 and you go god damn just so many
01:14:43 businesses
01:14:43 have a vested interest in uh in china
01:14:47 and and keeping relationships with china
01:14:49 and while
01:14:50 kovit is happening and the economic
01:14:52 downturn they've been buying up shit
01:14:54 left and right
01:14:55 oh yeah i i mean because again as a big
01:14:57 gamer
01:14:58 tencent is big in the game industry is
01:15:01 owners of just about everything and
01:15:03 that's one you know one of the biggest
01:15:04 companies in china what do they make
01:15:06 everything like what games uh i think
01:15:09 they own fortnite now
01:15:11 they own a bit of pub g i believe
01:15:14 they they own just they own
01:15:17 percentages of just about every company
01:15:20 god damn and china owns them
01:15:25 wow i don't know how i feel about that
01:15:28 [Laughter]
01:15:32 like when trump was saying he's going to
01:15:34 ban tick-tock i was like oh i want to
01:15:36 see how this plays out
01:15:36 yeah yeah that is actually i was like oh
01:15:39 this
01:15:40 that that's positive you know
01:15:43 in a way it is it is it is but then
01:15:47 instagram came along with reels yeah
01:15:49 like their tick-tock rip-off i don't
01:15:50 know who's using that though is anybody
01:15:52 using reels
01:15:53 i'll keep an eye on you a little busy to
01:15:57 pay attention to that shit this week
01:15:59 yeah we've had a busy week
01:16:01 you do tick-tock no man no no no
01:16:04 you know i figured you shouldn't be a
01:16:06 comedian over 30 on tick tock that seems
01:16:08 to not go well it seems
01:16:10 like it doesn't go wrong
01:16:13 [Laughter]
01:16:14 someone just got a special offer
01:16:16 basically though that sarah cooper just
01:16:17 got a netflix special you sent me that
01:16:20 yeah that's the lady who
01:16:21 i wonder who that is she lip syncs
01:16:24 donald trump's
01:16:25 speeches oh okay that's gonna go good
01:16:27 i'm excited for that
01:16:33 it is there's many things that are viral
01:16:34 that i understand that is not one of
01:16:36 them
01:16:37 i have watched that i was like she's
01:16:38 just saying what he's saying
01:16:40 but she's doing it like there's nothing

01:17:00 time she'd been grinding and i just did

01:18:17 yeah the netflix actually looks like my
01:18:18 tougher brother
01:18:22 the netflix thing is so interesting
01:18:24 because they basically
01:18:25 taken over the stand-up comedy special
01:18:28 now
01:18:28 yeah it used to be comedy central it's
01:18:32 really
01:18:32 the comedy central the like getting
01:18:34 people to watch the streaming
01:18:36 online comedy central specials it's just
01:18:38 not the same yeah i know and then they
01:18:40 geo blocked that shit so
01:18:41 oh do they really yeah oh no so like if
01:18:44 you're in the uk you can't watch it
01:18:46 oh no i don't know why that's a smart
01:18:49 decision
01:18:49 that's a terrible decision who made that
01:18:51 one
01:18:53 someone higher than the people i talk to
01:18:55 like so your special that you did for
01:18:57 comedy central
01:18:58 that's they they geo-block that they
01:19:01 yeah they geo-blocked that then they put
01:19:03 it out so now it's actually it's out on
01:19:04 youtube for free right now for 30 days
01:19:06 so i was stoked i was like oh people
01:19:08 in canada and uk can finally see it and
01:19:09 then i was getting messages being like
01:19:12 no we can't oh wow yeah
01:19:15 that's stupid it's not the best decision
01:19:18 uh just not too confused what we were
01:19:21 just talking about
01:19:22 uh her she's not have a stand-up special
01:19:24 according to the press release it's a
01:19:25 comedy special that will be
01:19:27 full of vignettes dealing with issues of
01:19:29 politics race gender class and other
01:19:30 subjects
01:19:31 short interview sketches and more
01:19:32 shenanigans oh so she's a writer
01:19:34 she put she wrote something the sketch
01:19:37 show event
01:19:38 yeah but it's i just got i felt it was
01:19:40 weird to me that
01:19:41 she things were going viral because she
01:19:44 was just lip-syncing things the
01:19:46 president had said so it would be like
01:19:47 the president's voice it'd be her
01:19:49 lip-syncing it
01:19:50 and everybody be like this is amazing
01:19:51 and i'm like she's
01:19:53 she's not she's just saying the words
01:19:56 with her lips
01:19:58 while he talks like what's missing
01:20:01 something
01:20:01 yeah well you know we we are around
01:20:04 comedy a lot
01:20:05 that's what i always have to remember is
01:20:07 that my palette is
01:20:09 you know more refined yeah i think it's
01:20:12 also like there's a gene for certain
01:20:13 things

01:20:16 dead gene people love

01:20:57 and then they went up to like twelve
01:20:58 hundred dollars real quick yeah so i was
01:21:00 like that's
01:21:01 that's out of my covet price range for

01:21:15 pretty trippy the green ones come on
01:21:17 they do look pretty trippy mm-hmm really
01:21:20 weird
01:21:21 put those on this comedy store stage
01:21:23 come on mm-hmm
01:21:24 what's up with the bear i think that's
01:21:26 their logo a bear
01:21:28 yeah i looked into it one time because i
01:21:30 didn't know either he's named after
01:21:32 the they're like engineer who was one of
01:21:34 the guys
01:21:35 that developed lsd i think or something
01:21:37 like that what
01:21:38 yeah i'll pull up his name again just a
01:21:41 second to show you one of the guys but
01:21:43 albert hoffman synthesized lsd right but
01:21:45 up here
01:21:46 so he's like a guy who worked with
01:21:47 hoffman when i looked it up he said it
01:21:49 like
01:21:49 somewhere in the range of like four
01:21:51 million hits of ass that he is
01:21:52 responsible for
01:21:54 uh wow
01:21:57 i wonder how many ideas can directly be
01:21:59 traced to that guy's work
01:22:03 a lot of ideas will come to you through
01:22:04 acid i never done acid
01:22:06 want to do it now mm-hmm okay
01:22:10 you should try micro dose in it i feel
01:22:13 it i'd be up to
01:22:14 interesting i like mushrooms ausley
01:22:18 stanley
01:22:20 uh he's a clandestine chemist an audio
01:22:24 engineer and clandestine chemist he was
01:22:25 a key figure in the san francisco bay
01:22:26 area hippie movement during the 1960s
01:22:28 and played a pivotal role in the decades
01:22:30 counter culture
01:22:32 so he supplied the acid
01:22:35 probably worked for the cia this
01:22:36 motherfucker five million doses
01:22:38 [Applause]
01:22:39 [Music]
01:22:41 stanley was first known was the first
01:22:43 known private individual to manufacture
01:22:45 mass quantities of lsd by his own
01:22:46 account
01:22:47 between 65 and 67 only in two years
01:22:50 he produced no less than 500 grams of
01:22:54 lsd
01:22:54 accounting to a little more than five
01:22:57 million doses
01:22:58 and his professional name was bear oh
01:23:00 interesting
01:23:01 so that's why so they're just like tied
01:23:04 to lsd
01:23:05 the dead that's why you got to listen
01:23:07 and he's the engineer that engineered
01:23:08 the music
01:23:09 so that's why they say you have to be on
01:23:10 that shit to understand the sound
01:23:13 yeah that's what they say i mean
01:23:15 everyone i know who does acid
01:23:17 loves the dead when they're on acid he
01:23:20 developed the whole it's called the wall
01:23:21 of sound sound system he developed one
01:23:23 of the largest
01:23:24 i thought that was phil spector he
01:23:25 that's a different thing but oh he has
01:23:27 an own wall sound
01:23:29 yeah this phil spector case is one of
01:23:31 the creepiest hollywood cases
01:23:33 ever oh
01:23:36 i remember uh when he got arrested and
01:23:39 then i didn't really know who he was and
01:23:40 i
01:23:41 did a deep dive into who he was after he
01:23:44 got arrested
01:23:45 for murder and apparently just that was
01:23:46 his thing like pulling guns on people
01:23:48 but uh when you see him in the trial
01:23:50 with all his crazy wigs on you realize
01:23:52 like this crazy motherfucker was
01:23:54 involved with some of the biggest bands
01:23:56 some of the best music
01:23:58 and he was a psychopath like the entire
01:24:01 time
01:24:02 yeah but i think uh especially back then
01:24:05 even now our type of businesses
01:24:06 can kind of hide those people right they
01:24:08 don't
01:24:10 i've always hung out with as long as
01:24:11 i've done comedy like oh that guy's a
01:24:13 drug dealer this guy doesn't but not
01:24:16 that guy's jesus his wall of sound is a
01:24:20 production formula to make records
01:24:24 whereas the engineers was an actual like
01:24:26 wall of sound
01:24:27 of physical sound amplifier speakers
01:24:30 that was touring around the country to
01:24:32 oh oh make
01:24:34 noise to blast in your face oh okay so
01:24:37 he called the same thing okay so he had
01:24:39 developed something for touring that
01:24:40 they called the walls
01:24:41 okay yeah i don't know jack shit about
01:24:44 music
01:24:46 do you play any instruments no never
01:24:48 played a piano when i was very young
01:24:50 but no yeah that's another one of those
01:24:53 things where i feel like if i got into
01:24:54 that
01:24:56 and start playing guitar or something
01:24:58 like that like how long
01:24:59 that seems like a long road
01:25:03 yeah you gotta choose yeah it has to be
01:25:05 your passion whenever i picked up an
01:25:07 instrument it
01:25:08 always felt real foreign it never felt
01:25:10 at home at all
01:25:11 yeah it's but it seems like a dope thing
01:25:14 to learn
01:25:15 yeah like i wish i could shred i just
01:25:18 wish you could play
01:25:18 something on the piano it seemed like
01:25:20 you know people just fall in love if you
01:25:21 could play the piano
01:25:22 yeah you'd be sophisticated yeah you
01:25:24 just sit down someplace
01:25:26 and you just start playing the piano
01:25:28 right you walk into a hotel
01:25:29 and there's a hotel lobby there's a nice
01:25:31 bar there with a piano you're like
01:25:33 let me sit down and play you a melody
01:25:35 yeah and everybody starts gathering
01:25:37 around yeah
01:25:37 they think you're cool that's a thing
01:25:40 but that's like
01:25:41 that scene in animal house with dudes
01:25:42 playing the guitar at a party
01:25:44 and uh remember that scene
01:25:48 do you remember the scene a little no
01:25:51 you could tell
01:25:52 i was blanking i know what you're
01:25:54 talking about because it's an old joke
01:25:55 but
01:25:55 i uh i'm not a big animal house guy yeah
01:25:58 he
01:25:58 steals a guitar from him smashes him
01:26:00 over the head with it or did he no he
01:26:02 didn't smash him over the head with it
01:26:03 he broke the guitar
01:26:05 yeah this guy this scene
01:26:10 can we get a little volume
01:26:11 [Laughter]
01:26:13 john belushi's listening to this guy
01:26:16 playing this horrible folk music
01:26:22 i can't do it yeah i know people will
01:26:25 youtube
01:26:25 will have an issue google those words
01:26:27 you'll find it
01:26:32 back in the day and this is what
01:26:35 everybody wanted to do
01:26:38 sorry did you ever see an animal house
01:26:41 yeah probably when i was young don't
01:26:43 remember call it it's a classic
01:26:45 that's what it seems very slow now
01:26:47 though it is that's the problem
01:26:49 there's a lot of those movies that just
01:26:50 don't hold up i tried to watch porkies
01:26:52 the other day
01:26:53 yeah he's like this is a rape movie i
01:26:56 saw two terrible things get announced
01:26:57 yesterday that for the projects maybe
01:26:59 they won't get made but three men
01:27:00 and a baby remake and then a potential
01:27:04 fresh prince
01:27:05 reboot but a drama not a comedy what
01:27:09 yeah what why can't they just come up
01:27:13 with new ideas
01:27:14 i agree with that listen how about a
01:27:16 show where there's a comedian who has an
01:27:17 autistic kid sounds great
01:27:20 does it come out soon yeah it should be
01:27:21 like a netflix thing or maybe amazon
01:27:23 prime they do a good job
01:27:25 you ever seen the marvelous mrs maisel i
01:27:27 have not it's very good
01:27:29 especially the first two seasons i kind
01:27:31 of it kind of soured for me the third
01:27:33 season but
01:27:34 it's a pretty good representation of
01:27:36 stand up i mean not
01:27:37 not part not perfect but pretty good
01:27:40 pretty good
01:27:41 like close enough where you go huh
01:27:44 that's just funny hearing you that you
01:27:45 watch that show because i don't think
01:27:46 anybody would think that you would watch
01:27:48 that show
01:27:48 why is that because it's just funny like
01:27:50 joe rogan just going like you know what
01:27:52 i like
01:27:52 marvelous mrs thanks i like a lot of
01:27:55 girly shit

01:27:59 day fiance
01:28:00 no i don't know if i can go that far
01:28:02 think about it
01:28:03 i like uh unbreakable kimmy schmidt yeah
01:28:05 yeah that's not shit
01:28:07 that's the optimistic and charming come
01:28:09 on
01:28:12 that's a funny fucking show though right
01:28:14 yes that's a good show and that's like
01:28:16 they got like eight seasons
01:28:18 yeah that's a good one i mean and so
01:28:20 bleak
01:28:21 you know that's the type of shit i like
01:28:23 when you can take bleak things and still
01:28:25 be so funny
01:28:25 the bleakest means someone who got
01:28:28 kidnapped and forced into a sex cult in
01:28:30 a fucking bunker
01:28:32 and then 15 years later she gets out
01:28:33 with a super positive attitude and is
01:28:35 facing all the modern world's issues
01:28:37 yeah fucking great she's such an amazing
01:28:39 actress
01:28:40 yeah well it's a tina fey show too that
01:28:42 lady she figure shit out she dear does
01:28:46 so um this vision board
01:28:49 this ultimate vision board the ultimate
01:28:51 thing is a show
01:28:52 and movies and stuff like that is there
01:28:54 anything that you have made manifest
01:28:56 that's actually happened because of this
01:28:58 vision board yeah yeah my house
01:29:00 was one of my first major vision board
01:29:03 things i put that
01:29:04 when i didn't have a house living in my
01:29:06 apartment
01:29:07 and what it does for me is just kind of
01:29:10 it focuses me it gives me
01:29:12 a direction instead of just being this
01:29:14 guy who doesn't have his hands on the
01:29:16 rudder or the or
01:29:16 whatever the fucking thing that steers
01:29:18 the boat um
01:29:20 and so like i was like oh i want to get
01:29:21 this house and so in order to get the
01:29:22 house i had to stop
01:29:24 just like not paying attention to my
01:29:27 money i had to stop just buying random
01:29:29 sneakers every week i had to start being
01:29:31 like okay i need to build my credit
01:29:32 i have to pay these old bills from when
01:29:34 i was 20 and didn't pay those off
01:29:36 because i didn't think i'd ever have
01:29:37 fucking
01:29:38 money so who cares if i skip out on this
01:29:39 rent you know i had to go back and
01:29:41 undo all these things so that i could
01:29:44 get to that ultimate vision of getting
01:29:46 the house and then we end up
01:29:48 i haven't had my house for two years now
01:29:50 fucking love it
01:29:51 i put that i wanted to be on reno 9-1-1
01:29:53 in there and i taped that i don't know
01:29:55 if i got cut out or not because it's you
01:29:56 know six-minute quibby thing
01:29:58 but um a lot of things i put on my
01:30:00 vision board end up happening
01:30:02 that's interesting to say that you had
01:30:03 to go and like redo
01:30:06 things that you fucked up
01:30:10 like what made you what what brought you
01:30:12 to that decision
01:30:13 was just that um if i wanted to move on
01:30:16 a lot of ways in my life
01:30:17 the same with my like dealing with with
01:30:20 my ex-wife and things like that i had to
01:30:21 go to therapy i had to start
01:30:24 i wasn't trusting anyone i was like
01:30:26 anyone who wants to hang out with me
01:30:28 just because i have a little bit of
01:30:29 money or because i've been on a couple
01:30:30 of shows or doesn't that
01:30:31 and which is so ridiculous like no most
01:30:33 people don't even fucking know me you
01:30:34 know
01:30:35 so but that some people did and then
01:30:37 sometimes
01:30:38 that would happen people would be
01:30:39 hanging out with me just because
01:30:41 they thought i could introduce them to a
01:30:43 fun party or
01:30:44 someone else cooler than me and i had to
01:30:48 stop looking for that and being so
01:30:50 worried about that
01:30:52 and i had to go and do just a mindset i
01:30:54 think
01:30:56 this rapper i also really like waka
01:30:57 flocka flame many people talk about this
01:30:59 i
01:30:59 just changed my mindset from a survival
01:31:02 mindset to a thrive mindset of like oh i
01:31:04 am
01:31:04 okay i am fine so i can go ahead and
01:31:07 just take care of this business
01:31:09 i'm going to get more work i'm going to
01:31:11 get more jobs because i've proven myself
01:31:13 it's not a fluke
01:31:14 you know it's not a one it's not a
01:31:17 mistake that they made in hiring me
01:31:19 they you know i'm i'm going to be here
01:31:22 what made you like
01:31:24 what where did where did you come up
01:31:26 with this idea to sort of correct your
01:31:28 mindset
01:31:28 was it just like realizing personally
01:31:31 that the way you were looking at things
01:31:32 was wrong
01:31:33 or did you read something or it was just
01:31:35 mostly that
01:31:36 things in my life were getting better
01:31:37 but i wasn't getting happier
01:31:40 i had more money i had anything i could
01:31:44 buy video game wise all that stuff i was
01:31:46 having a bunch of sex
01:31:47 but i wasn't happier i was still lonely
01:31:50 i was still like um
01:31:54 not doing all the things i wanted to do
01:31:56 i was i was chasing
01:31:57 things just for money you know um and so
01:32:00 i had to just
01:32:01 kind of take a step back and go like
01:32:04 okay like
01:32:04 don't just chase every single thing you
01:32:07 see
01:32:08 figure out what you really go back to
01:32:10 like when you started stand up
01:32:12 and like what do you want and all i
01:32:13 wanted when i started stand up was to be
01:32:15 able to pay my bills and do the things i
01:32:17 want to do
01:32:18 and that hasn't changed was this a
01:32:20 gradual process yeah for sure for sure
01:32:23 like a couple years so you just realized
01:32:25 was it like
01:32:26 you were sitting at home this was not
01:32:28 from reading anything it's just from you
01:32:29 recognizing that something was wrong it
01:32:32 was me recognizing something was wrong
01:32:33 in me
01:32:34 and me watching the people around me
01:32:37 me watching um people with more success
01:32:41 than me
01:32:41 me watching just seeing that like oh
01:32:45 like okay i feel this way and i have
01:32:47 this little bit of money with it but
01:32:48 maybe if i get more money i won't but
01:32:50 then
01:32:50 meeting people with millions of dollars
01:32:52 and being like oh holy shit like
01:32:54 some people still don't have their shit
01:32:56 together no matter how much money they
01:32:58 have
01:32:58 and some people know exactly who they
01:33:02 are and they know what they want they're
01:33:05 they're happy within themselves
01:33:08 and i wanted to be that um
01:33:12 that's it's very interesting that you
01:33:14 recognize it and made the adjustment
01:33:16 you know that's a sign of a strong mind
01:33:19 you you were you were able to recognize
01:33:21 that the current
01:33:22 patterns that you were operating under
01:33:23 weren't they weren't fulfilling your
01:33:25 needs
01:33:26 so you had to like assess but then also
01:33:30 move forward and make a change
01:33:31 that's a very difficult thing to do
01:33:34 yeah it's difficult but does that
01:33:37 coincide with weight loss
01:33:38 um it's probably a little bit after the
01:33:40 weight loss but that's
01:33:42 the weight loss kind of gives me the
01:33:43 motivation for it you know like
01:33:45 my whole life has been motivation for
01:33:47 every other step i take you know
01:33:49 like i came from just being a college
01:33:51 gra drop out with a son
01:33:53 when i was 20. he was diagnosed with
01:33:55 autism i was 23
01:33:56 i didn't have any money my ex-wife was
01:33:58 more of a albatross around our thing
01:34:00 like you know
01:34:01 i have full custody of my son so it
01:34:05 was just like i got her figure this shit
01:34:07 out and once that
01:34:09 we had a little apartment and everything
01:34:10 was like okay well i fucking figured
01:34:11 this shit out i get my health together
01:34:14 and that was a big one because my my
01:34:16 doctor even told me she was like you
01:34:17 know there's so many
01:34:18 people i tell all the time just diet
01:34:20 exercise diet exercise
01:34:22 you need to lose weight you need to get
01:34:23 better you're going to die i tell this
01:34:25 to people all the time and you go you
01:34:26 know how many
01:34:27 of my fucking patients have done
01:34:30 anything about it
01:34:31 and then she says you that's it you're
01:34:34 the only one
01:34:34 that i know that i've talked to about
01:34:36 this who's just done it through diet and
01:34:38 exercise
01:34:39 so you have and she's just like you have
01:34:41 a strong fucking mind
01:34:42 so i took that to heart and i was like
01:34:45 well fuck if i can do
01:34:46 that if i can lose 140 pounds
01:34:49 fucking throw it you know i would work
01:34:51 out throw up and
01:34:52 in my you know give this more to my
01:34:55 trainer he was just like all right you
01:34:56 threw up
01:34:57 yeah can you breathe all right let's get
01:34:58 back at it you know yeah
01:35:00 you know where a lot of times people
01:35:01 would throw up and they'd be like okay
01:35:02 well that was enough for today
01:35:04 you know he he would never push he he
01:35:06 told me day one he's like you're
01:35:08 you're a very strong man and we're gonna
01:35:10 just unlock
01:35:11 what you've been covering up with bad
01:35:13 decisions
01:35:14 that's uh it's so true what your doctor
01:35:16 said and it's so interesting
01:35:18 when you think about the goals that
01:35:19 people have like one
01:35:21 of the major goals if you asked
01:35:23 americans
01:35:24 like what do you want to do besides be
01:35:26 successful have a family
01:35:28 have a career they want to lose weight
01:35:30 but what i said at the beginning of this
01:35:31 podcast you've done
01:35:33 one of the most difficult things a
01:35:34 person could do because you didn't just
01:35:35 lose weight
01:35:36 he lost a fuck load of weight and he
01:35:38 kept it off
01:35:39 and that to me is so
01:35:43 it's such a it's the craziest thing is
01:35:46 because it's like
01:35:46 it's not like gaining weight right like
01:35:49 gaining weight requires you got to eat
01:35:50 all that food
01:35:51 like you gotta like you gotta really get
01:35:53 after it like if you really want to gain
01:35:55 weight man
01:35:56 you got to fucking put on that you know
01:35:57 you got to be there to eat
01:35:59 you got to get it done people have no
01:36:01 problem with that you know
01:36:02 but the not eating you're literally
01:36:05 asking someone to not do something
01:36:07 just don't do something and it's harder
01:36:10 to do
01:36:11 than to do something yeah and then the
01:36:13 exercise
01:36:14 is maybe even harder to do than to not
01:36:17 eat those are two really difficult
01:36:19 things to do that you need to do both of
01:36:21 them
01:36:21 in order to really get your health in
01:36:23 order in order to really lose weight and
01:36:25 everybody knows it
01:36:26 yeah everybody knows it but nobody does
01:36:27 it yeah and then they always want to
01:36:29 know what's the trick what's the trick
01:36:30 what's the trick no fucking trick
01:36:32 bro there's no trick trick is to walk
01:36:34 through that door especially with
01:36:35 exercise
01:36:36 it is just like a door like yeah and
01:36:38 that's what my wife said to me oh she
01:36:40 was like oh you went from
01:36:41 she's like you were a guy who didn't
01:36:43 exercise and now you're a guy that
01:36:44 exercises she's like there's no part of
01:36:46 you
01:36:47 that gets up and goes oh this is hard
01:36:49 why am i doing this she's like this is
01:36:50 what you do because this is what you do
01:36:52 yeah and the hardest part is making that
01:36:54 transition because you go through that
01:36:55 first
01:36:56 three weeks and you're just like i
01:36:58 fucking hate this why the fuck am i
01:37:00 doing it
01:37:00 you're looking at me back when we could
01:37:02 go to gyms you're looking at other
01:37:03 people going oh well they're fucking
01:37:04 attractive and this and that yeah and
01:37:07 i'll never be like that
01:37:09 you know and you just gotta get rid of
01:37:10 all that i hate that i hate it when i
01:37:12 see that in comedy
01:37:13 because i just mostly because i'm used
01:37:14 to i go i know where it comes from and i
01:37:16 have that in myself when people are like
01:37:18 i don't exercise i don't know and
01:37:20 they're so fucking proud of it
01:37:22 you know i'm just like well okay we'll
01:37:24 see you in 10 years when you change your
01:37:25 fucking mind and
01:37:26 are you just aren't successful so you
01:37:29 know that's
01:37:29 your thing yeah yeah that's the only
01:37:31 thing i would tell young me
01:37:33 like everything i've done i'm like well
01:37:35 that's my
01:37:36 process and i'm glad everything i
01:37:38 wouldn't change a thing
01:37:39 the only thing i would have done is told
01:37:41 young me be like hey motherfucker if you
01:37:42 want to be successful
01:37:44 you just got to be healthy so just get
01:37:46 get at it it's just better
01:37:48 for your brain too man you think better
01:37:49 yeah i mean i
01:37:51 i am very fortunate in that i got into
01:37:54 exercise i'm working out very very young
01:37:56 and i've never not done it but for me
01:38:00 if i don't do it i don't think right i'm
01:38:03 i'm
01:38:03 i'm just and i think it's it's also it
01:38:06 has to be
01:38:07 because i've been doing it so long that
01:38:09 my my brain
01:38:11 has this requirement to burn off this
01:38:13 energy
01:38:14 and that also the kind of exercise i do
01:38:17 is so intense
01:38:18 there's so much aggression that if i
01:38:20 don't do that
01:38:22 for a few days that shit stores up and
01:38:24 then
01:38:25 then i'm not the nicest person i don't
01:38:28 like me
01:38:28 if i don't work out for four or five
01:38:30 days i don't like me and i'm i'm not
01:38:33 i'm not that nice i can get edgy real
01:38:36 quick
01:38:36 but if i work out every day i'm the
01:38:39 nicest person
01:38:41 i want i'm just it's like real simple
01:38:43 like the body has requirements the mind
01:38:45 has requirements
01:38:46 if you don't give it those requirements
01:38:49 it starts to malfunction
01:38:50 yeah it's something i've thought about
01:38:52 since i was very young just to
01:38:54 as our society that we've kind of
01:38:56 mislabeled a lot of words like work
01:38:58 work and play and what those things mean
01:39:00 and i feel like
01:39:02 a lot of things that we consider work
01:39:04 aren't work at all they're busy work
01:39:06 they're
01:39:06 like a waste of time they're just you
01:39:08 spending time in a place
01:39:10 for a set number of hours whereas what i
01:39:13 consider real work
01:39:14 is getting yourself better um exercising
01:39:18 reading meditating to me that is work
01:39:21 that is
01:39:21 how you actually get better at things
01:39:24 and
01:39:25 and that's just kind of how i look at
01:39:26 this is my job i work in entertainment
01:39:29 even if i didn't work in entertainment
01:39:30 it wouldn't matter
01:39:31 but the fact that i do my main jobs are
01:39:33 fuck
01:39:34 stay ready keep material going make sure
01:39:36 i fucking look good and just have a
01:39:38 positive attitude and if i keep it that
01:39:40 simple
01:39:41 everything else is fine yeah that work
01:39:43 that that making sure you do that work
01:39:46 for some people it's just it's an alien
01:39:48 concept they never really developed that
01:39:50 habit but if you do if you just i swear
01:39:52 to god anybody listen to this like
01:39:54 oh i don't think i could do that if you
01:39:56 just started
01:39:57 just left foot right foot left foot
01:39:59 right foot just do it please
01:40:01 just get it going just get going once
01:40:03 you get going so easy to keep going it
01:40:05 becomes momentum
01:40:06 so much harder to start from from a
01:40:09 standstill position
01:40:10 but once you're doing it and you're kind
01:40:12 of like hey i worked out every day this
01:40:14 week
01:40:15 hey i worked out every day this month or
01:40:16 hey i worked out four days a week for
01:40:19 the past
01:40:19 six weeks like fuck man you got some
01:40:22 momentum now
01:40:23 yeah it just feels good and especially
01:40:25 you know when i was 360 it's not like i
01:40:27 was going around doing box jumps and
01:40:29 tire pushes and that shit i was walking
01:40:32 i was
01:40:32 walking and walking and walking and
01:40:35 doing some light
01:40:36 bicep curls or whatever you know it you
01:40:38 it doesn't matter where you start
01:40:40 did you go all in right from the jump
01:40:41 when you said all right i'm going to
01:40:42 lose weight did
01:40:43 or did you vacillate did you no once i
01:40:45 you know again
01:40:46 my molar decision and i make it so once
01:40:48 the decision was made
01:40:50 it was more like okay it's out of my
01:40:52 hands i will do what
01:40:53 my trainer says and that's it and that's
01:40:56 been the crazy thing because he'll then
01:40:57 like recently he'll talk about other
01:40:59 clients and he'll be like oh you know
01:41:01 you wanted him to do this he didn't want
01:41:02 to do it so he didn't do it and i go oh
01:41:04 i i never comprehended that i could tell
01:41:07 you no
01:41:08 you know like i never even thought that
01:41:10 i could be like yeah i know i'm tired
01:41:12 fuck it
01:41:13 you know i thought oh i'm paying you
01:41:15 this is your job so i just listened to
01:41:17 you
01:41:18 you know and but i think you know so
01:41:21 that way it's just me having a good
01:41:22 attitude about it i
01:41:23 i don't once i was in it i was in it and
01:41:26 then later came the thing of like oh i
01:41:28 have to mentally now
01:41:29 undo like the fact that i still
01:41:32 want these things you know i it was
01:41:34 easier to just okay well i'm not doing
01:41:36 it because i need to protect my health
01:41:37 and i'm gonna die but once
01:41:39 i got down to a healthy way it was like
01:41:42 okay
01:41:42 now we have to deal with the mental
01:41:44 aspect i went to like overeaters
01:41:46 anonymous for a couple of classes and i
01:41:48 didn't like that
01:41:48 what is that like it's like alcoholics
01:41:50 anonymous basically but it's the same
01:41:52 book
01:41:53 even that they read from yeah so i think
01:41:55 they just need to get their shit changed
01:41:56 and get their shit together because
01:41:58 it doesn't match up because they read
01:42:00 you these like things like oh i
01:42:02 reached my lowest moment i lost my
01:42:04 family i was living in a train
01:42:06 and i was like well no i can't relate to
01:42:08 that my lowest moment is that i
01:42:10 you know took a bite of a doughnut and
01:42:12 then put it on top of the trash and then
01:42:13 came back and got it and then had to put
01:42:15 it
01:42:15 deeper in the trash that's what i need
01:42:18 to work on
01:42:20 yeah it's a different kind of addiction
01:42:22 right mm-hmm
01:42:24 yeah though you don't really lose your
01:42:25 life the same way
01:42:27 you know junkie it's slow you lose your
01:42:30 life in a weird way you lose your
01:42:31 physical life
01:42:32 yeah you start telling i just remember
01:42:36 mentally the change of being like well
01:42:37 you know i just don't want to do that i
01:42:39 don't want to
01:42:40 i can't physically go scuba diving they
01:42:43 won't let me at my way so you know i'm
01:42:44 just not interested in any of that
01:42:46 you know and now she's like i won't do
01:42:48 anything i went to you know with the pro
01:42:50 wrestling school for a few months did

01:49:52 doing this thing with and i didn't
01:49:54 i didn't know too much about him i knew
01:49:57 he was referred to me by this other guy
01:49:59 we're doing this project together and
01:50:01 then um
01:50:03 he sends me this email um basically

01:50:22 i got a way better job now i have a
01:50:24 family i'm married i have a kid

01:50:35 and you can do the things you want to do
01:50:36 you just got to push yourself and you
01:50:37 just got
01:50:38 and feeding off the energy of hearing

01:50:42 and recognizing like there's no
01:50:43 difference between you and me there's no
01:50:45 difference between me
01:50:46 and and the next guy is just i've done
01:50:48 it and you can too
01:50:50 that's what people need to hear you see
01:50:52 someone like kevin hart and you go
01:50:53 that guy's an alien like i just i'm not
01:50:55 like that i can't do it but you're not

01:51:11 the people who tell you you can't do it
01:51:13 you know

01:51:15 lived in
01:51:16 i've never met someone who's truly been
01:51:19 successful who turns around and goes
01:51:20 well

01:51:23 because they know

01:52:26 oh i'm so proud of you look at you and
01:52:27 you're in movies and this and that and
01:52:29 you're amazing and you
01:52:30 you're doing so well for your your your
01:52:33 son my
01:52:33 my nephew and i was just like this is so
01:52:36 cool coming from the lady that used to
01:52:38 call me the n-word
01:52:44 that's amazing
01:52:47 do you still talk to the ex uh no not
01:52:49 really
01:52:50 sometimes just you know keep her up to
01:52:52 date to what's going on with her son
01:52:53 make sure that their relationship is
01:52:55 still strong uh but
01:52:57 me and her no you know she just she
01:53:01 i understand if i was in her position i
01:53:03 wouldn't like what
01:53:05 everything turned out
01:53:09 she ain't never been the niece
01:53:14 i don't know what that's like yeah as
01:53:18 much as you like to see some people
01:53:19 succeed
01:53:21 there's uh there's a certain amount of
01:53:22 satisfaction in knowing that you
01:53:25 bypassed all the pitfalls that other
01:53:27 people have fallen into
01:53:28 yeah especially if you had some
01:53:30 non-non-fun
01:53:31 relationship issues with them yeah it
01:53:34 truly is that's right you know i still
01:53:36 try to
01:53:36 it's my you know my son's mom so i
01:53:38 always have a love for her and
01:53:40 i want her to be successful and i want
01:53:43 her to be happy
01:53:44 but i'm very i know i won
01:53:47 [Laughter]
01:53:51 oh it's awful
01:53:56 it's awful to take happiness and other
01:53:58 people's failures like that but
01:54:00 yeah but that is their choices and yeah
01:54:03 it's like also like you can learn a lot
01:54:05 from other people's failure
01:54:06 truly as much as you can get out of
01:54:08 people's success
01:54:09 man look at someone who you know that's
01:54:11 just sabotaging their life left and
01:54:13 right and you can learn from that too
01:54:15 the thing one of the things that you
01:54:16 were talking about that i think is so
01:54:17 important is that taking ownership of
01:54:19 your fuck ups
01:54:20 taking ownership of the things you did
01:54:21 wrong trying to rectify that
01:54:24 trying to just you know you don't want
01:54:25 to repeat those patterns
01:54:27 recognize them you know develop
01:54:29 development
01:54:30 getting better evolve i think that's a
01:54:32 thing you know
01:54:33 through especially social media lately
01:54:35 that we we don't
01:54:37 we don't allow people to evolve we don't
01:54:39 allow them to change we hold them to the
01:54:41 same
01:54:41 statement that they made 10 15 20 years
01:54:44 ago
01:54:44 and if someone's an asshole today that's
01:54:46 fine i understand that
01:54:48 it's okay to not fuck with people but
01:54:50 like
01:54:51 to judge someone over things they did 10
01:54:53 15 20 years ago
01:54:55 obviously case-by-case spaces but you're
01:54:58 you're
01:54:59 you're denying the existence the
01:55:01 existence of evolution you're not you're
01:55:02 denying that people change
01:55:04 and that people can get better and i i
01:55:08 just always believe in that because i've
01:55:09 seen it in myself i've seen it in my
01:55:10 friends and the people around me
01:55:12 there's so many people that if they
01:55:13 truly some people don't want to change
01:55:16 and they don't ever they never will but
01:55:19 i met a lot of people who who weren't
01:55:21 the best people and
01:55:22 they pulled their shit together because
01:55:24 they had to yeah i agree i agree
01:55:26 wholeheartedly and i know
01:55:28 i've grown and become a better person
01:55:30 too and through all that hard work
01:55:32 and i i almost don't fault people that
01:55:34 feel that way because
01:55:36 it's it's fucking hard today man you
01:55:39 know and it's less hard for us because
01:55:40 we had this advantage that we were kind
01:55:42 of
01:55:43 we're moving you know we already had
01:55:45 momentum when this shit hit
01:55:46 and we were in a business where you know
01:55:49 we're very fortunate that
01:55:50 when you do well in show business you
01:55:52 can make a decent amount of money you
01:55:53 can save some of it you can put it aside
01:55:56 but there's so many people out there
01:55:57 that have no hope and i understand the
01:55:59 bitterness and the anger
01:56:00 i understand it all i get it i mean this
01:56:03 is a fucked up
01:56:04 time it's a fucked up time where like
01:56:06 half the country can't work
01:56:07 yeah and uh when you have that you're
01:56:10 going to have
01:56:11 just a dystopian perspective on
01:56:15 everything and that's what you have with
01:56:16 people today and
01:56:18 i just want us to come out of it i
01:56:20 really do and when we come out of it man
01:56:22 i hope we look back and
01:56:24 just appreciate where we are if we get
01:56:26 to a point where we can all gather and
01:56:27 go to comedy clubs and go to restaurants
01:56:29 and movie theaters and normal shit like
01:56:31 we used to do
01:56:31 sporting events you can go see pro
01:56:33 wrestling live
01:56:35 all that shit man i just hope we really
01:56:37 enjoy it
01:56:38 yeah and maybe we will i mean maybe
01:56:40 maybe it'll be like we'll be better
01:56:42 because we'll recognize like hey man
01:56:44 this could all go away
01:56:46 now we know it can all go away yeah just
01:56:48 learning to um
01:56:49 remind myself to respect the audience
01:56:52 more and to
01:56:53 yeah i'm clearly nothing without an
01:56:56 audience i'm nothing
01:56:57 nothing and sometimes i didn't always go
01:57:00 into like every show being like i need
01:57:02 to give these people
01:57:03 you know yeah i'm sure you know sure uh
01:57:05 and so i'm just trying to be more
01:57:07 aware of that and any chance although it
01:57:09 was great like i
01:57:10 was like okay i did this one show where
01:57:12 they
01:57:13 there's a little stage and a screen and
01:57:15 people can see you and i was like oh it
01:57:16 felt so good to get on stage again and i
01:57:18 want to be grateful for it
01:57:19 and they asked me to come back and then
01:57:21 i slept through it and i was
01:57:22 mad at myself at first but then i was
01:57:24 like no this is like getting back to
01:57:26 normal
01:57:27 yeah that's funny i did some stand-up i
01:57:31 did a weekend the houston improv
01:57:33 but i was like man i can't catch covet i
01:57:35 gotta get out of here
01:57:36 i did you know one weekend and i did all
01:57:38 the right things kept the fuck away from
01:57:40 people wore a mask did my shows got off
01:57:42 get out of there i didn't take pictures
01:57:44 didn't hug anybody
01:57:45 but i was still like but what if i got
01:57:47 it and what if i give it to someone i
01:57:49 love
01:57:49 yeah just i got really high
01:57:53 uh the next day and i got real paranoid
01:57:56 i was like what if i have it
01:57:58 what i have it i'm going to give it to
01:57:59 people yeah and then i was like i can't
01:58:01 do this
01:58:02 yeah i went through the same mindset
01:58:03 because i had a couple of gigs on on the
01:58:05 daca still
01:58:07 and um but i went to that same thing
01:58:09 like oh i want to do stand up so bad i
01:58:10 want to perform
01:58:11 i want to feel that feeling of people
01:58:14 applauding when i enter a room
01:58:16 but i just fucking
01:58:19 that same paranoia like oh what if i
01:58:21 give it to someone and you know i'm
01:58:22 healthy and that's fine but i give it to
01:58:24 someone and they give it to their
01:58:25 grandma and their grandma dies because
01:58:26 they went to
01:58:27 his hear me do some dumb bullshit jokes
01:58:30 i can't i don't exactly
01:58:31 exactly but at a certain point in time
01:58:34 like what do we do if this is
01:58:36 normal forever like what if covet
01:58:39 doesn't go away and this is just the
01:58:40 deal this is just how things are
01:58:42 then what do we do do we decide then
01:58:44 we'll fuck it let's just have comedy
01:58:46 clubs
01:58:47 people gonna get it they're just gonna
01:58:48 get it there is no cure there's nothing
01:58:49 you could do
01:58:50 do we just live like like this
01:58:54 i don't think so then sound good that
01:58:55 doesn't sound good so the question is
01:58:57 always like are we living like this
01:58:59 because
01:58:59 we're waiting for them to develop enough
01:59:02 hospital beds
01:59:03 and waiting for them to develop some
01:59:05 sort of a treatment that's
01:59:07 responsible that really does work well
01:59:09 is that what's going on
01:59:11 because if we i mean we're all hoping
01:59:12 for a vaccine but if there's nothing
01:59:14 if it doesn't happen let's just just
01:59:16 imagine it doesn't what do you do
01:59:18 at some point in time we're gonna have
01:59:20 to say fuck it we're gonna have to get
01:59:21 back to what
01:59:22 to work and get back to life yeah
01:59:25 that'll be a weird life
01:59:26 i don't want that and then i hadn't
01:59:28 thought about that until you brought
01:59:30 it up damn but now i am thinking about
01:59:32 it
01:59:33 and it's like a horror movie well here's
01:59:35 the thing man there's more than one
01:59:36 version of this disease right now
01:59:39 more than one there's a one in india
01:59:40 that's so different from the one here
01:59:42 that if they develop a vaccine for the
01:59:44 one that's in north america it won't
01:59:45 work for the one that's in india
01:59:47 and this is it's possible that this
01:59:49 thing is going to morph
01:59:51 like the common cold or like a lot of
01:59:52 other viruses and spread all over the
01:59:54 place
01:59:55 well if they don't have a disease
01:59:57 prevention if there's no way
01:59:59 other than keeping your body healthy
02:00:02 keeping your immune system strong
02:00:05 we're not going to live like this man we
02:00:06 can't just live like this forever we're
02:00:08 living like this
02:00:09 temporarily this is the idea so we have
02:00:12 to
02:00:12 like that is a possibility that we need
02:00:16 to take into account
02:00:18 it's interesting it means life's gonna
02:00:20 be different means a lot of people gonna
02:00:22 die
02:00:22 a lot of people wearing masks a lot of
02:00:24 people have fucked up teeth that are
02:00:25 gonna be real happy i'm okay with the
02:00:27 math
02:00:27 same because that's been i mean i got
02:00:28 used to that from japan from when i went
02:00:30 to japan for two weeks i was like oh
02:00:32 that's fine uh when you went to japan
02:00:34 for two weeks was it coveted or no
02:00:36 pre-co of it but a lot of people just
02:00:37 wear masks if they're feeling a little
02:00:39 ill you wear a mask well that's a polite
02:00:41 thing over there right
02:00:43 yeah well that's why they they did an
02:00:45 amazing job they got to a point where
02:00:46 like i think the entire country only had
02:00:48 a thousand deaths
02:00:49 which is amazing but uh especially if
02:00:52 you
02:00:53 because people consider the size of
02:00:54 japan that it's not like
02:00:56 super populated but if you consider that
02:00:58 most of the population in japan is in
02:01:01 just very dense areas like tokyo is
02:01:04 everyone right on top of each other and
02:01:05 they never locked down
02:01:07 they kept working the entire time they
02:01:09 just wore masks and they only had a
02:01:10 thousand deaths
02:01:11 it's pretty amazing i have a buddy of
02:01:12 mine as a political commentator and he
02:01:14 was like
02:01:14 you need to look at this sent me this
02:01:16 article explaining all the things japan
02:01:18 did they did just basically they follow
02:01:20 order you know they they're polite you
02:01:23 know if you go over there like
02:01:25 i wasn't i've only been to tokyo once
02:01:26 but it's like
02:01:29 amazing how different their culture is
02:01:31 like how polite they are
02:01:32 and how they avoid you know like on the
02:01:33 streets like everybody
02:01:35 there's no garbage everywhere nobody
02:01:37 picks up their shit you don't even
02:01:38 it's rude to walk around and eat yeah
02:01:42 they're supposed to go take it to the
02:01:44 proper place get rid of your trash
02:01:46 and then go about your day it's crazy
02:01:48 yeah they have
02:01:50 they just have patterns of behavior
02:01:54 and patterns of like they're just the
02:01:56 what they accept
02:01:58 or what they expect rather from society
02:02:00 from people
02:02:01 and they all agree yeah truly discipline
02:02:04 yeah
02:02:05 if no one if you're ever gone yeah you
02:02:07 ever get the chance to travel you
02:02:08 go because it's fucking amazing i can't
02:02:10 wait to go to other countries again
02:02:11 oh i want to go to some weird places i
02:02:14 can't wait
02:02:15 once the shit is if if this shit ever
02:02:17 lifts up i got i
02:02:19 just want to go i want to take in as
02:02:20 many weird cultures i want to go to bali
02:02:23 i want to see what that's like i want to
02:02:24 go to indonesia i want to go
02:02:26 to a lot of the pacific islands i want
02:02:28 to go to the philippines i want to go to
02:02:30 a lot of places i've never been
02:02:32 that i've just seen in videos i just
02:02:33 like and i want to go to egypt
02:02:36 that's that's the thing i've been
02:02:37 kicking myself in the head about
02:02:39 like why didn't i go see the pyramids i
02:02:41 do i need to go see that
02:02:43 i'd like to do that every person that
02:02:45 i'm friends with schultz went
02:02:46 he went right before covid everybody
02:02:48 that i'm friends with that went there
02:02:49 they're like bro
02:02:51 they're like this shit changed my life
02:02:53 like it's so big and so crazy like what
02:02:55 the fuck
02:02:56 is this who built this how did this
02:02:58 happen
02:02:59 what was this culture like and the fact
02:03:01 that you got
02:03:02 fucked up cairo right there next to
02:03:06 this ancient civilization that's so far
02:03:08 more sophisticated
02:03:10 in their structures like that's one of
02:03:13 them things where
02:03:14 i think perspective shifting places
02:03:18 are very important to go to just because
02:03:20 it just gives you
02:03:21 we're so used to like los angeles or
02:03:23 boston or wherever you're from you're
02:03:24 used to these cities and this is this is
02:03:26 how people live and then you go to
02:03:28 chichen itza and you go
02:03:29 oh shit like what were the mayans doing
02:03:33 you know these motherfuckers were doing
02:03:34 this shit 1500 years ago
02:03:36 like what is this how were they doing
02:03:38 this why were they doing this
02:03:40 what was life like back then you
02:03:41 realized like the pattern that we're in
02:03:44 is just the pattern that we're in it
02:03:45 doesn't mean this is the only pattern
02:03:46 that human beings follow
02:03:48 just like just like you were talking
02:03:50 about japan that's a different pattern
02:03:52 they're on a different pattern
02:03:53 their pattern they got into this really
02:03:55 disciplined pattern being polite wearing
02:03:57 a mask
02:03:58 our pattern is fucking chaos but more
02:04:00 but also
02:04:01 our patterns more creative that's a
02:04:03 weird thing about our pattern
02:04:05 over here in america we do a lot of wild
02:04:07 shit but man we create a lot of good
02:04:10 shit you know if you think about all the
02:04:12 movies and the art and the comedy and
02:04:14 the music
02:04:16 all the shit that comes from this one
02:04:17 continent yeah that means it can only
02:04:19 come from a lack of structure
02:04:21 and from chaos and things going on
02:04:22 that's why we have so many
02:04:24 forms of art that are created here
02:04:26 that's why jazz is created here is why
02:04:28 hip-hop is created here stand-up comedy
02:04:30 invented here yeah
02:04:32 yeah it is it's like that is what's
02:04:35 interesting right it's like you gotta
02:04:36 kind of have both
02:04:38 of those things you gotta kind of have
02:04:41 chaos but you also kind of gotta have
02:04:44 some discipline too
02:04:46 that's why i think that's one of the
02:04:47 reasons why america's done so terrible
02:04:49 with this uh this covid reaction we
02:04:52 we're the worst at it
02:04:53 and all the fucking big countries we are
02:04:56 the worst
02:04:56 yeah it's crazy when you really look at
02:04:59 they're just
02:05:00 like we don't the rest of the world is
02:05:01 just like we don't want americans right
02:05:04 now
02:05:04 because you're in an underdeveloped
02:05:06 nation medical
02:05:07 you're fucking idiots you just you guys
02:05:09 don't listen you want to have like
02:05:11 a big protest where you don't wear masks
02:05:13 like we want our fucking freedom
02:05:15 and just thousands of people march down
02:05:17 the street
02:05:18 saying we don't want to wear a mask bill
02:05:20 gates the devil
02:05:21 fuck fouchy like people are crazy
02:05:23 they're wild people
02:05:25 but they come up with some good shit
02:05:28 right
02:05:30 such a conundrum pardon me
02:05:33 i love america i look i'm some fucking
02:05:35 american flag behind me it's a reason
02:05:37 for that i love america
02:05:39 genuine i love the concept i love the
02:05:42 concept of i
02:05:43 you know i'm the grandchild of
02:05:44 immigrants my family all came over here
02:05:47 from europe
02:05:47 i love the fact that these people where
02:05:50 we're like
02:05:50 the ancestors of these people that
02:05:53 decided wherever they were
02:05:55 they just didn't want to be there
02:05:57 anymore you know and they
02:05:58 they no not me yeah
02:06:03 [Laughter]
02:06:07 or realize uh hey
02:06:12 you know that's that that is
02:06:15 for sure the most fucked up part of
02:06:18 america
02:06:19 right it is the most fucked up for sure
02:06:23 how it started slave owners that wanted
02:06:26 to be free
02:06:29 but it's also um there's a beauty that
02:06:32 people don't see i think
02:06:33 a lot of there's a lot of like in
02:06:36 everyday
02:06:37 white people that i talk to there's a
02:06:39 little bit of fear of this just like
02:06:41 this black anger of people being like
02:06:44 not only the
02:06:44 black lives matter that we want you know
02:06:46 reparations we want everything back we
02:06:48 want
02:06:48 um you know which would also be great
02:06:50 it'd be fun but
02:06:52 to me what's so beautiful about america
02:06:55 is this level of forgiveness that's
02:06:58 built into our
02:06:59 structure to the fact that we can have
02:07:03 that history that you know horrible
02:07:06 history and then
02:07:08 there's no other country that freed
02:07:10 those people and then they live
02:07:11 there right next to their oppressors you
02:07:13 know
02:07:14 and then and there's forgiveness
02:07:18 and there's balance and there's like oh
02:07:19 well we just want to continue to be a
02:07:21 part of this
02:07:22 lifestyle and we want to succeed and
02:07:24 have our own freedoms like you we're not
02:07:26 trying to didn't take over and now white
02:07:29 people are slaves it's this beautiful
02:07:31 thing
02:07:31 that there's this like forgiveness there
02:07:34 and that they want to see
02:07:35 the table yes yeah yeah
02:07:38 and also the amount of creativity that
02:07:41 comes from that culture
02:07:42 and just stop and think of that right
02:07:44 like through
02:07:45 pressure diamonds are created and just
02:07:48 look at the
02:07:49 black american community and think about
02:07:52 all the
02:07:53 different forms of art that not just
02:07:56 originated
02:07:57 with black americans but were mastered
02:08:00 by them to a point where like
02:08:01 like even rock and roll yeah like jimi
02:08:03 hendrix
02:08:04 is the greatest guitar player of all
02:08:06 time i mean you go and look at
02:08:08 stand-up comedians i mean there's
02:08:10 there's so many
02:08:12 musicians so many so many artists
02:08:15 so so i mean that's the crazy thing
02:08:17 about art right like so
02:08:19 much of art is this dynamic expression
02:08:23 that comes from pain
02:08:24 yeah yeah i mean that's to me the beauty
02:08:27 and the alchemy in art
02:08:28 is to take your traumas take your pain
02:08:31 and then to turn those things into your
02:08:33 successes and your
02:08:34 in the reason why you have finances yeah
02:08:37 it's amazing
02:08:38 yeah and i'm hoping that through the i
02:08:40 mean this obviously
02:08:41 racial relations are in this really
02:08:43 strange upheaval right now they're in a
02:08:46 bad spot
02:08:47 they're in a bad spot but they're also
02:08:48 in a spot where there's a potential for
02:08:50 growth
02:08:51 you know like when you see these black
02:08:53 lives matter protests
02:08:55 what the the the thing that gives
02:08:57 everybody hope
02:08:58 is that people are together walking down
02:09:01 the street
02:09:01 in unity and that they recognize that
02:09:05 this is this is a unique moment to make
02:09:07 things better
02:09:08 this is a unique moment to take a stand
02:09:10 to talk about things
02:09:11 to recognize that there's problems and
02:09:13 out of the
02:09:14 the brutal murder of one man this
02:09:17 eruption that has existed all
02:09:18 throughout not just north america but
02:09:20 it's spread throughout the globe
02:09:22 it's a crazy time and through crazy
02:09:24 times
02:09:26 oftentimes on the other end of it you
02:09:28 get a better world truly
02:09:29 truly yeah i look i choose to look at
02:09:31 those positives because
02:09:33 police brutality is not a new subject
02:09:35 you know oppression is not a new subject
02:09:37 by any means but the reaction to it the
02:09:40 the
02:09:41 the amount of allies the amount of times
02:09:42 where i see
02:09:44 i get so excited when i see all these
02:09:46 young white allies these people these
02:09:48 millennials
02:09:49 are you know that people kind of make
02:09:50 fun of and they're the ones in in the
02:09:52 fucking streets the first they're
02:09:54 they're first coming like no this is
02:09:55 bullshit we don't we don't do this
02:09:57 anymore
02:09:58 and i love that to me that's tremendous
02:10:00 progress because i'm
02:10:01 you know there was a million man march
02:10:03 years ago years ago when i was a child
02:10:06 there was marches about this type of
02:10:08 things
02:10:09 and before i was a child you know that's
02:10:12 something i talk about yeah my mom was
02:10:14 out on those marches getting
02:10:15 bit by dogs and sprayed by fire hoses
02:10:18 and
02:10:18 now we reach to the point where i sit at
02:10:21 home playing video games and i send my
02:10:23 white assistant out to protest for me
02:10:26 that's true progress you send your
02:10:28 assistant out to protest

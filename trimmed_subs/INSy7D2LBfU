00:01:23 packs
00:01:24 eight packs with eight ounces yeah nips
00:01:26 you got a case of nips
00:01:27 or a case of beer and then you went out
00:01:30 to colorado and they had 3.2
00:01:33 3.2 alcohol low alcohol if you're unlike
00:01:36 you don't
00:01:37 18 and 21. oh really that's what you
00:01:39 have to drink then when you turn 21
00:01:41 they give you the full dose they used to
00:01:44 be a club on the hill left uh
00:01:45 i forget what it was in the university
00:01:47 of boulder downstairs and that's what
00:01:50 they served you
00:01:51 3.2 beer right around the time i was
00:01:53 turning 18
00:01:54 was the time they made it 21 years old
00:01:56 i'm pretty sure find out when they did
00:01:57 it in massachusetts when did
00:01:59 massachusetts make the drinking age
00:02:01 from 18 to 21 i feel like i missed it by
00:02:03 like a year or two
00:02:05 but probably for good they were like
00:02:07 jesus christ
00:02:08 like i remember that when i was in
00:02:09 elementary people were mad about that
00:02:11 at least make it harder for them fucking
00:02:14 animals thank you for the colder days my
00:02:15 pleasure
00:02:16 i did the blood test okay it's 1979
00:02:19 they've raised the drinking age from 18
00:02:21 to 20.
00:02:23 huh but when was it 21 oh okay 84. dude
00:02:26 exactly okay so 84 i was 17 that son of
00:02:30 a bitch
00:02:31 and he raised it from 20 to 21. dukakis
00:02:33 also fucked up he gave out furloughs to
00:02:36 prisoners and one escaped and killed
00:02:37 somebody
00:02:38 so when i got into a halfway house
00:02:40 wasn't it somebody when i got to a
00:02:42 halfway house everybody was mad at the
00:02:43 caucus
00:02:44 because you couldn't have furloughs no
00:02:46 more oh he used to
00:02:48 yes furlough about it was really
00:02:50 something or another right
00:02:52 i forget the whole story but i know that
00:02:54 people in prison were furious
00:02:56 because they couldn't go to fucking on
00:02:58 furloughs no more
00:02:59 because the caucus let them go for like
00:03:01 four days like a fucking
00:03:03 you know like club med for four days
00:03:05 he's a fucking prisoner
00:03:06 i think let him go to club med and that
00:03:08 was the end of that dune
00:03:10 well they're releasing a lot of
00:03:11 prisoners right now because of covet
00:03:14 they're opening up the doors 18

00:03:21 motherfucker who accused him yeah

00:03:26 this is the best idea kids
00:03:27 there's a lot of those people are very
00:03:28 violent like it depends on what you
00:03:30 letting out
00:03:31 if you're letting out some dude who's
00:03:32 sold weed you should have let him out a
00:03:34 long time ago
00:03:35 you know you're letting out some guys
00:03:36 selling mushrooms let that guy out
00:03:38 don't put keep in a fucking cage with
00:03:40 people who are murderers
00:03:42 we've had this conversation before
00:03:44 you're gonna let the people that are
00:03:45 non-violent
00:03:46 drug offenders yes all of them
00:03:48 non-violent drug offenders
00:03:50 first time first-time offenders unless
00:03:54 you know this this you know what the big
00:03:55 thing in jail is sometimes when you go
00:03:57 to county
00:03:58 there's a big dui population really
00:04:00 there's motherfuckers that can't stop
00:04:02 getting duis
00:04:03 i think my ex-brother-in-law has the
00:04:05 record in colorado
00:04:08 i'm not making a joke here like there's
00:04:10 people
00:04:11 that stay in the system because of the
00:04:13 dui problem
00:04:14 you know they got to blow into a tube
00:04:16 before they start that car
00:04:18 yeah my friend robbie yeah they were all
00:04:20 types of shit
00:04:21 so and then they put you in work release
00:04:23 that's a complete different situation
00:04:26 then you you know they have different
00:04:28 levels of it you know
00:04:30 they're blowing in the thing it takes
00:04:31 some time too he couldn't just start his
00:04:33 car
00:04:33 so it was cold out like we were playing
00:04:35 pool and i go how long does that take
00:04:37 he's like it takes like five minutes
00:04:39 just gotta sit here
00:04:40 because he has to check to see to make
00:04:42 you're all right and you can't there's
00:04:44 no getaways
00:04:44 like if someone's chasing you you up
00:04:47 with the car you got to blow on the
00:04:48 thing
00:04:49 i had a friend that did that he used to
00:04:50 just pay people five dollars to blow in
00:04:52 there
00:04:53 he would get hammers come here what are
00:04:54 you doing blow in there do you know what
00:04:56 happened in chicago
00:04:58 do you have an idea what happened this
00:04:59 weekend in chicago no do you you know
00:05:01 oh about the crazy yeah yeah there was a
00:05:03 shooting
00:05:04 there was a shooting and then there was
00:05:05 some crazy looting they broke in the
00:05:07 tent
00:05:08 jamie was the first one to tell me that
00:05:09 there was like a incorrect story
00:05:12 the incorrect story was that a 14 year
00:05:14 old girl was shot is that what it was or
00:05:16 15 year old girl was shot i heard yeah a
00:05:18 15 year old was shot and killed by the
00:05:19 police but it was misinformation that
00:05:21 was and i don't know how that got out or
00:05:23 who put it out initially i didn't find
00:05:25 out that part of it but
00:05:26 it was actually a 20 year old that was
00:05:28 not killed and was in the hospital
00:05:31 so it got i don't know i yeah we're one
00:05:34 of those away
00:05:35 we're one of those away from this whole
00:05:37 fucking thing exploding in
00:05:39 in different cities again why do you
00:05:41 feel this strongly about los
00:05:42 angeles lately there's too many people
00:05:46 very ever since the houston trip you've
00:05:49 been a different person
00:05:50 well i've been thinking about it for
00:05:51 quite a while i've been thinking about
00:05:52 leaving la for a while
00:05:54 because i think i don't this is just my
00:05:56 my my feeling i don't think this is a
00:05:57 healthy way to live
00:05:59 i don't think it's good for your brain i
00:06:01 really don't i think
00:06:03 the people that live here like i wonder
00:06:06 if it's a coincidence
00:06:08 that so many people that live in cities
00:06:10 have
00:06:11 like um it's like cities are always
00:06:14 democratic
00:06:15 right almost always cities are rarely
00:06:17 republican
00:06:18 and that weird like i don't know i mean
00:06:21 is houston like that that's a pretty big
00:06:23 city dallas is a pretty big city but i
00:06:24 think they might be blue i think the
00:06:26 cities might be blue
00:06:27 and then the states are all you know the
00:06:30 surrounding area is red
00:06:31 me and jamie grew up red i wonder but i
00:06:33 always used to think that was because
00:06:34 they were smarter
00:06:35 i just think that they were more
00:06:36 educated so they're more likely to be
00:06:39 democrats because i i
00:06:40 my family was democrats growing up and i
00:06:42 always felt like that was like
00:06:43 the people who were really interested in
00:06:44 freedom of speech really interested in
00:06:46 education and really interested in
00:06:48 welfare and making making programs for
00:06:51 poor people
00:06:52 and prison reform they didn't want they
00:06:53 didn't want the death penalty
00:06:55 they wanted you to have the right to
00:06:57 choose that's what it was always to me
00:06:59 so why the fuck are they all like lumped
00:07:01 up in cities like what is that it's
00:07:02 because that's where all the
00:07:02 universities are
00:07:04 but there's some universities are in you
00:07:06 know in the middle of nowhere too it's
00:07:07 weird
00:07:07 it's weird how cities are like like if
00:07:09 you just forget if you had
00:07:11 a dog in the fight if just looking at
00:07:13 people it's odd
00:07:14 that these big giant clumps are almost
00:07:17 always the lean democrat
00:07:19 it's weird and then when shit like
00:07:21 what's going on now
00:07:22 happens where you have violent reactions
00:07:26 on a regular basis like on a regular
00:07:28 basis there's riots on a regular basis
00:07:30 there's crazy shit going on in portland
00:07:32 seattle they're trying to burn federal
00:07:33 buildings
00:07:34 this isn't rare this is like every day
00:07:37 we're totally accustomed to it if you
00:07:40 noticed
00:07:40 you see a fucking looting in a riot and
00:07:42 a building on fire on tv you don't even
00:07:44 flinch
00:07:45 you don't even flinch they used to be a
00:07:46 big deal right remember like the waco
00:07:49 days
00:07:49 that was a big fucking deal there was a
00:07:51 standoff
00:07:52 with the feds and a compound and there
00:07:55 was a guy who thought he was jesus he
00:07:56 was fucking everybody's wife
00:07:58 and they had guns and you're like holy
00:07:59 shit was fucked up
00:08:01 was waco 94-95 pix was alive because
00:08:05 hicks talked about it on stage
00:08:07 so it had to be pre-night i think hicks
00:08:10 died in like 93.
00:08:12 in that area it was like hicks and
00:08:13 kinnison died within a couple of years
00:08:15 of each other it was
00:08:16 it was waco and then the oklahoma city
00:08:18 bombing yeah
00:08:19 blew off fucking waco 93 okay 93 and
00:08:22 then 94
00:08:23 95 was the oklahoma city bombings which
00:08:27 really
00:08:28 fucked with me that week i snorted a lot
00:08:30 of coke the oklahoma city bombings are
00:08:32 very interesting very interesting very
00:08:34 interesting there's a lot of weird stuff
00:08:35 april 19
00:08:36 1995 was still living in boulder do you
00:08:39 see that building look at the building
00:08:41 there's people to this day that don't
00:08:43 believe that that was just a car
00:08:46 filled with some sort of explosive that
00:08:48 did that damn
00:08:49 the most thing i remember that you say
00:08:51 it's too uniform it was a daycare on the
00:08:53 basement
00:08:54 oh that's what destroyed me that week
00:08:57 and i remember i bought a big batch of
00:08:59 coke and i cut it and i was trying to
00:09:01 sell it
00:09:02 and i did the whole bag in four fucking
00:09:04 days just watching the coverage on this
00:09:08 there are some fucking insane people out
00:09:10 there and there are
00:09:11 there are people that are so insane
00:09:12 they'll plant a bomb
00:09:14 in front of a building and blow the
00:09:16 whole side of it they don't give a fuck
00:09:17 who's
00:09:18 mcvay yeah and then you had the
00:09:22 unabomber around that time
00:09:23 look at how it blew that's crazy
00:09:27 so there was all these reports the
00:09:29 problem is like eyewitness reports after
00:09:31 traumatic events like that they're
00:09:32 always off
00:09:33 people always like you know they don't
00:09:35 know what they saw they're so fucked up
00:09:37 and you could tell them what they saw
00:09:38 and then they'll repeat what you said
00:09:40 it does happen with people when they
00:09:41 look there's a big crazy explosion like
00:09:43 that
00:09:43 people so you don't know who's telling
00:09:45 the truth and who's but there was a lot
00:09:47 of people that were saying they saw
00:09:48 people carrying off bombs that were
00:09:49 unexploded
00:09:50 like they saw like the fbi carrying off
00:09:52 bombs like that there was more than one
00:09:54 bomb
00:09:55 and then the way it looks if you look at
00:09:57 the way the building exploded
00:09:59 the way they were explaining is i was
00:10:01 watching something on it
00:10:02 that the way one of those bombs would go
00:10:05 off
00:10:06 if it was uh just fertilizer bomb like
00:10:09 it wouldn't it wouldn't necessarily go
00:10:10 off that way where it looks like the
00:10:11 whole side of the building is going out
00:10:13 you know that it would be located the
00:10:16 blast would be
00:10:17 all the damage would be where the truck
00:10:19 was located
00:10:20 but being a moron and not knowing shit
00:10:22 about explosives
00:10:25 i don't know if that's true but it does
00:10:27 get interesting
00:10:28 like who gave him this information why
00:10:31 is he blowing up that building like what
00:10:33 what the fuck is going on you could do
00:10:35 that with a truck and some manure
00:10:38 is that real
00:10:41 that's a hell of a fucking bomb can you
00:10:44 do that
00:10:45 like could any crazy fuck just fill a
00:10:47 pickup truck up
00:10:48 fill with fertilizer do what they have
00:10:51 to do to light it on fire and make it
00:10:52 explode and blow up a building like that
00:10:56 was it one guy was a suicider or
00:10:59 he just left it there and detonated it i
00:11:01 think he just
00:11:03 left it and detonated then they caught
00:11:05 him
00:11:06 the one guy that was a pair they were
00:11:09 part of a
00:11:10 paramilitary group in the hills of
00:11:11 michigan or something something extra
00:11:13 spooky about those
00:11:14 white dudes who live in the woods who
00:11:16 are plotting to overthrow the government
00:11:19 right there's something extra spooky
00:11:21 about those guys
00:11:22 and that's what you think of when you
00:11:23 think of timothy mcveigh think of those
00:11:25 kind of people
00:11:26 those uh you know those people like it's
00:11:29 a real sad story you ever hear the ruby
00:11:31 ridge story
00:11:32 no that's a real sad one that was a guy
00:11:35 who got in a
00:11:35 uh standoff with the cops with the
00:11:37 federales and they fucking shot his wife
00:11:40 while she was holding the baby
00:11:42 i forget exactly what they were after
00:11:44 him for
00:11:46 i forget exactly what it was but it was
00:11:48 an egregious overuse of power
00:11:51 i mean they murdered these people and
00:11:53 the snipers murdered these people and
00:11:55 the people eventually shot back and then
00:11:58 i mean just a bloodbath but it became a
00:12:00 symbol of how
00:12:02 if you give people that kind of power
00:12:05 you know you don't know exactly how
00:12:06 they're gonna wield it you give people
00:12:07 the power to like pull guns out and
00:12:08 storm some fucking cabin in the middle
00:12:10 of the woods
00:12:12 some people are some people are more
00:12:14 than willing to shoot did you ever see

00:13:42 about the last time you were at the

00:13:46 time you were at the melrose improv
00:13:49 now open them when you go to melrose now
00:13:52 think of the last time you were there
00:13:54 and think of how long it's going to take
00:13:56 for melrose to be like that again
00:13:58 melrose was destroyed already that is
00:14:00 why i am leaving because of things like

00:14:27 looking at this as
00:14:28 an 18-month recovery west hollywood is
00:14:32 going to be less

00:14:39 spread it throughout the community in
00:14:40 hollywood
00:14:41 west hollywood's going to be last did

00:14:46 going to be last so
00:14:47 i'm sorry to give you the fucking bad
00:14:49 news joey you just
00:14:50 said got went off on joe about starting
00:14:53 this podcast off with bad news and now
00:14:55 you made me
00:14:56 feel worse because we're talking about
00:14:57 why we're leaving here
00:14:59 we're talking about why we're leaving
00:15:01 why we're leaving that's why and the
00:15:03 other thing that bothered me was
00:15:05 the knowledge ain't bad right now you
00:15:07 know like they were
00:15:08 like you're homeless for 24 hours there
00:15:11 and then you disappear let me tell you
00:15:13 something about burping going bird bank
00:15:15 every time i go i go to burbank just to
00:15:17 look around i got friends that live in
00:15:18 burbank
00:15:19 i go to two areas of birdbank i go down
00:15:21 magnolia to victory
00:15:23 by albertos and i see that
00:15:26 street is getting very eerie
00:15:29 like when you go on that street you feel
00:15:31 two things are coming
00:15:33 an earthquake every time i'm on magnolia
00:15:36 i think of an earthquake like
00:15:37 this is good earthquake weather for some
00:15:40 reason by the doughnut hut
00:15:41 and then you see those people lining up
00:15:43 for guns
00:15:45 there's three stores three of them right
00:15:47 around me yeah joe rogan that's crazy
00:15:49 every day i was driving the other day 9
00:15:51 30 in the morning there was a big line
00:15:52 in front of
00:15:53 peterson's trying to buy guns yeah
00:15:57 yeah it's crazy uh i follow all the gun
00:15:59 shops around me and they all have
00:16:00 instagrams of course and they show all
00:16:02 the guns they got in for the day
00:16:04 and i'm like oh you know i might i might
00:16:06 get one of those and then like an hour
00:16:07 later it's sold out like shoes like
00:16:09 there's a line constantly on all three
00:16:11 of those guys
00:16:12 how sad is that well this is what this
00:16:13 is what's sad what's sad is
00:16:16 i mean we now we know we didn't have a
00:16:18 plan if everything went sideways like
00:16:20 this
00:16:20 and you can't like governors
00:16:24 and mayors it's their fault right but
00:16:26 it's not their fault because really
00:16:28 get that fucking job is a ridiculous job
00:16:31 in a pandemic
00:16:32 like all of a sudden there's a new
00:16:33 problem that's presented with you you
00:16:34 don't have the resources to fix it
00:16:36 people are not going to listen they're
00:16:38 going to want to party they're going to
00:16:39 want to still go out they're going to do
00:16:40 and you're in this situation where you
00:16:42 know a large percent
00:16:44 it didn't turn out to be as bad as we
00:16:45 thought it was but they thought it was
00:16:46 going to be a large percentage of our
00:16:47 population could possibly die
00:16:49 and you don't have the resources and
00:16:50 what do you do and governors
00:16:52 even though they they are in that
00:16:54 position they're in that position
00:16:55 because they got elected
00:16:57 they're not in that position because
00:16:58 they passed a battery of tests and show
00:17:00 that they know exactly how to respond to
00:17:02 any given circumstance
00:17:03 they were charismatic they had the right
00:17:05 money behind them they said the right
00:17:07 things
00:17:07 they back the right bills and then you
00:17:09 become a mayor and then you become a
00:17:10 governor but it doesn't mean you know
00:17:12 what to do if
00:17:12 things go sideways and no one knows what
00:17:15 to do and the fact that they were always
00:17:17 getting those checks
00:17:18 they're always getting those checks no
00:17:20 matter what happened no matter what shut
00:17:22 down
00:17:22 they kept getting those government
00:17:23 checks and they told all these other
00:17:25 people that couldn't work
00:17:26 like you can't that's not a plan that's
00:17:29 not a sustainable plan you can't tell
00:17:31 people you can't work but i'm gonna keep
00:17:32 getting paid and i'm gonna tell you when
00:17:34 you can go back to work again
00:17:35 because people are gonna go fuck you
00:17:36 like you can't just keep everything shut
00:17:38 down
00:17:39 for five months that is california
00:17:42 i don't know what the proper response
00:17:44 would have been
00:17:46 i don't know but this wasn't it this is
00:17:48 wasn't the best case scenario and
00:17:50 again not a fucking word about your
00:17:52 health not a word about taking vitamin d
00:17:54 not a word about exercise not a word
00:17:56 about drink water not a word about cut
00:17:58 out sugar
00:17:58 not a word about use this as an
00:18:00 opportunity to lose weight we have to up
00:18:02 our metabolic health we have to be
00:18:03 we have to take vitamins we have to be
00:18:05 better about our health not one word
00:18:07 everything's wearing a mask and you
00:18:09 can't do this and you can't do that
00:18:10 don't open this and don't open that
00:18:12 and look they weren't prepared that's
00:18:14 all is they're not bad people like
00:18:15 people think that they wanted to
00:18:16 sabotage
00:18:17 the the state or sabotage the city i'm
00:18:19 sure garcetti and
00:18:21 newsome are nice guys they probably
00:18:24 are fine to hang out with the problem is
00:18:27 nobody was ready nobody knew what the
00:18:28 fuck this was i can't hang out with

00:18:40 a joint with him maybe and talk to them
00:18:41 and they'll go you're right
00:18:43 i fucked up but garcetti's too what
00:18:46 about the fucking

00:18:49 assault because
00:18:51 what jackie lacy's husband is getting
00:18:54 charged with a misdemeanor assault
00:18:57 because when they went to his house to
00:18:58 protest that brother pulled out a piece

00:19:44 the life of a family
00:19:46 when you see someone abuse someone like

00:26:43 i grew up
00:26:45 hanging out with guys that were

00:26:48 i ripped signs down as a kid for people
00:26:50 i did all that political
00:26:52 dirty shit as a kid and guess what by
00:26:54 the age of 13
00:26:56 i saw the theft at the municipal level
00:27:01 i couldn't imagine the thievery at the
00:27:04 presidential the senatorial level
00:27:07 and the governor level i couldn't
00:27:08 imagine what the thievery was okay
00:27:11 i saw it firsthand as a child i was
00:27:13 involved with it
00:27:14 i saw the payoffs i went to long island
00:27:17 with this family
00:27:18 i saw all this shit i saw how things got
00:27:21 done
00:27:22 you know so i lost my faith in it
00:27:26 like i don't really believe and i think

00:27:43 that drug passed
00:27:45 and every year i donate 5 million to joe
00:27:47 rogan it's a little more complicated
00:27:48 than that
00:27:49 it's but that's in the same fucking
00:27:51 neighborhood it's in the same
00:27:52 neighborhood

00:27:54 i'm agreeing with you you buy yourself
00:27:56 into this so yeah you know what as far
00:27:58 as politics i never trusted
00:28:00 so this disclaimer as a politician
00:28:04 i'm talking about as a human being i see

00:31:15 you take a shower
00:31:17 i'd have my process yeah i'd do a four

00:31:23 get all duded up
00:31:25 get in the fucking car go over laurel
00:31:27 canyon i'd be behind him sometimes
00:31:30 or shop going down laurel canyon fucking
00:31:33 tremendous
00:31:34 and also not got taken away yeah you
00:31:37 don't think we're suffering we don't
00:31:38 we're just
00:31:39 we we're learning to deal with it but we
00:31:41 got to take it away in the nicest time
00:31:42 ever for comedy
00:31:44 this is the thing like the people that
00:31:45 don't that didn't go to the comedy store
00:31:47 that weren't comedy store
00:31:48 regulars there's a image of the comedy
00:31:50 store that i think is from the darker
00:31:52 days
00:31:52 where people thought of the comedy store
00:31:54 is the comics are mean
00:31:56 and shitty to each other and that it's
00:31:58 like the industry never goes there
00:32:00 it's like a dark place like a dangerous
00:32:02 place but when we
00:32:04 got shut down in march that those last
00:32:07 few years were probably the nicest
00:32:09 friendliest years in the history of the
00:32:11 store people were so nice to each other
00:32:13 there's so many people that were
00:32:14 supporting each other and because
00:32:16 everybody had podcasts
00:32:18 like everybody kind of fed off of each
00:32:20 other doing that and so it was
00:32:21 beneficial to everybody to pump you up
00:32:23 like to let you like you let me know
00:32:24 about jeremiah you
00:32:26 you let me know about tony hinchcliffe
00:32:27 we let each other know about these guys
00:32:29 and everybody sort of circulates and
00:32:30 everybody does well together it was a
00:32:32 real
00:32:33 good environment man it felt good every
00:32:35 time you go there it was all hugs and
00:32:37 everybody was laughing everybody's like
00:32:38 i love that new tag or this or that
00:32:40 it's it's fun it was a good time it was
00:32:42 one of the most positive places
00:32:44 i've ever been to in terms of like a
00:32:46 community for comedians
00:32:48 it was super supportive and it was like
00:32:50 that for years man
00:32:51 like for the first year i was back i was
00:32:53 like i can't even believe i'm back
00:32:55 first show i did back was yours yeah
00:32:57 that was fun
00:32:58 and i think doug stanhope uh opened it
00:33:00 up remember he was just like guys
00:33:02 crazy show here yeah i feel my whole
00:33:06 time at the comedy store which is 23
00:33:08 years
00:33:09 was pretty fucking good you know i
00:33:12 didn't come out here to do anything i
00:33:14 came out here
00:33:16 i was a criminal and comedy won you know
00:33:19 i used to be
00:33:19 i was a criminal and a comic and comedy
00:33:22 won
00:33:23 and beat it yeah but i always knew joe
00:33:25 your your thing was always that
00:33:27 you would come from a very unsteady
00:33:30 unsteady base
00:33:31 and you could tell you were like a
00:33:33 loving guy
00:33:34 but you had to get to know you you had
00:33:36 it you got it you had to get through you
00:33:38 and then and then you were a really
00:33:39 loving guy but there was just like the
00:33:40 bridge you had a cross
00:33:42 but i knew a lot of people like you i
00:33:44 knew i knew people like you
00:33:46 no not as funny as you but i knew people
00:33:48 that were like brilliant but crazy in
00:33:50 this sort of same sort of way and it was
00:33:51 always the same
00:33:52 thing it was always like their childhood
00:33:54 was all fucked up
00:33:55 or there was there's a missing there
00:33:57 there's some shit
00:33:58 that goes wrong there and when you
00:34:00 develop like that when you grow like
00:34:02 that
00:34:02 in like such a chaotic experience like
00:34:05 yours
00:34:06 there's this is you know it's hard it's
00:34:09 harder
00:34:10 but when you get through you get through
00:34:11 with gifts that's what's interesting
00:34:12 about it it's like
00:34:14 it's harder for you than a person that
00:34:16 had like your normal
00:34:17 norman lock rockwell mom and pop sort of
00:34:20 a life
00:34:21 it's harder for someone like you it's
00:34:22 much more emotionally difficult you go
00:34:24 through much more
00:34:25 want for for love there's you're not you
00:34:28 don't you don't feel support you don't
00:34:29 feel stable
00:34:30 you grow up like that and it's it's very
00:34:33 hard to
00:34:34 write yourself as an adult because all
00:34:36 of us come out of our childhood which we
00:34:37 don't really have any control over
00:34:39 who our parents are and we don't we have
00:34:41 very little control over our experiences
00:34:42 when we're kids
00:34:43 but we come out of that shit shaking
00:34:46 like when we get onto the road
00:34:48 finally like not everybody comes onto
00:34:50 that road with the same amount of
00:34:51 stability
00:34:52 like some people come on that road and
00:34:54 like my mom is awesome my dad my mom
00:34:56 love each other
00:34:56 yay and then just going down the road
00:34:58 and other people like who am i my uncle
00:35:00 fucked me and
00:35:01 i'm not coke and i'm only 15 and that
00:35:04 there's a lot of those people out there
00:35:06 too
00:35:06 it's like a matter of like writing it a
00:35:09 matter of like
00:35:10 getting it stable a matter of like
00:35:12 getting your life in a position where
00:35:15 you feel like you can make good
00:35:17 decisions and you're in control of it
00:35:18 and it's not the same for everybody and
00:35:21 i knew
00:35:22 when i met you you were a good guy i
00:35:24 know you i knew you were a good man no i
00:35:25 knew that too
00:35:26 i knew right away i didn't question that
00:35:28 but i
00:35:31 you were distracting yourself with other
00:35:33 shit i didn't know how long i would last
00:35:35 here i thought this was just going to be
00:35:37 a
00:35:38 fluke and i would end up in new york
00:35:40 selling coke and the story is that i
00:35:42 became a regular
00:35:43 i broke the record i became a regular
00:35:45 within a month did you really
00:35:47 yeah i landed here january 29th that's
00:35:49 amazing i became a regular february 19th
00:35:51 on my 30-something birthday
00:35:53 well mixie admits he caught you at the
00:35:55 right time she caught me at the right
00:35:57 time and everybody kept saying to me he
00:35:58 has mitzi senior that's amazing
00:36:01 so i didn't really go through the whole
00:36:02 thing so now let's go back to that
00:36:05 area that area that era was
00:36:08 hard at the store i had to follow up
00:36:10 mooney every night and dave
00:36:12 tyree and a bunch of crazy people after
00:36:14 eleven it got crazy in there
00:36:16 and then holtzman would go on and clean
00:36:18 the house and you know it was just a
00:36:20 different
00:36:21 i saw the three different phases of the
00:36:23 store yeah then we saw the other phase
00:36:25 with that fucking
00:36:26 mutt laurel engine and his little crew
00:36:29 and i didn't go there for seven years
00:36:31 and then came the adam fucking era which
00:36:34 was pretty fucking goddamn special
00:36:36 pretty special he got so special that it
00:36:39 got overly special like
00:36:41 tuesday nights were fucking just like
00:36:43 you had to go down there prepared for
00:36:45 war like tuesday nights when you you
00:36:48 ever see like rambo before he's gonna
00:36:50 want to go somewhere
00:36:51 or at the expendables yeah they always
00:36:53 see them sharpen their knives
00:36:55 and setting all the equipment up and
00:36:57 shit like
00:36:58 before they go to war bradley cooper and
00:37:01 the sniper
00:37:02 that's how we were on tuesday nights
00:37:04 like we
00:37:05 we had to sharpen our fucking knives you
00:37:08 had to take your alpha brain
00:37:09 you didn't get high all day like you
00:37:11 know tuesdays you had to go down and
00:37:13 bring it back yeah yeah
00:37:14 it was pretty fucking interesting and it
00:37:17 became
00:37:18 but then on the other side of that it
00:37:20 started becoming monotonous for me
00:37:23 it was like i was on the road or i was
00:37:25 at the comedy store
00:37:26 i was on the road or was the comedy
00:37:28 store i was at home
00:37:30 i didn't do anything else for like three
00:37:31 or four fucking years am i mad at that
00:37:34 no no no no
00:37:35 i wish i would have gone to more parties
00:37:37 maybe yeah
00:37:38 maybe more concerts i wish i would have
00:37:40 done some more stuff when i went to new
00:37:42 york last year
00:37:43 to shoot the sopranos i saw my friends
00:37:47 and i saw how they lived now and who
00:37:49 they were now and we met every night we
00:37:51 went to a different
00:37:52 great restaurant for dinner and at a
00:37:54 quarter of nine they'd be yawning
00:37:56 and i'd be happy as fuck that they were
00:37:57 yawning because i'm just as fucking
00:37:59 tired
00:38:00 we're not kids no more and we would go
00:38:03 our separate ways and i'd go back to my
00:38:04 hotel and i go that was tremendous
00:38:07 and that's what you do now yeah but i
00:38:08 went out every night with a different
00:38:10 one to a different restaurant
00:38:11 and everybody has families you know it
00:38:15 just became something different for me

00:46:07 course thank you brother you could have
00:46:08 some of mine
00:46:09 no i'm all right because that's corona
00:46:12 test was tremendous i got one right here
00:46:14 just that swab in your nose i know she
00:46:16 took things out of my nose that would
00:46:18 we have to find out let's find out
00:46:20 what's keeping you going
00:46:21 make sure everything's i did the
00:46:23 antibodies test but then a dentist told
00:46:25 me she goes joey
00:46:26 the antibodies is no good the fda
00:46:29 approved one
00:46:30 is good it shows because whether or not
00:46:32 you've had it it's a respiratory illness
00:46:34 it shouldn't be in your blood so that's
00:46:36 what that's why she said that's why i
00:46:38 did the swab to be honest with you and i
00:46:39 didn't want to faint
00:46:41 i think that the weirdest moments joe
00:46:42 yeah but that's not real whatever she
00:46:44 just said that's not true okay it's in
00:46:47 your blood for sure

00:46:50 the best way to find out right in front
00:46:51 of you right in front of you thank you
00:46:52 right there
00:46:53 the best way to find out apparently is
00:46:54 you draw blood and then they do an
00:46:56 analysis of the blood
00:46:57 but the the pin prick is fda approved
00:47:00 and the swab
00:47:01 lets you know if you have like recent
00:47:03 infections and i gotta tell you
00:47:05 right here because you know i'm a man's

00:48:26 distancing
00:48:27 not one fucking complaint
00:48:30 but everybody's doing it when i found
00:48:32 this side i got pissed off
00:48:34 this is my life i've been paying dues
00:48:37 just like you i don't want to do movies
00:48:39 and i don't want to do tv but i got to
00:48:41 finish this movie
00:48:43 i thought that i read something in the
00:48:45 la times
00:48:46 that said that by adding covid to movies
00:48:50 it's going to add a million dollars
00:48:52 to the but like it's going to cost a
00:48:54 million dollars to do it properly
00:48:59 which is uh
00:49:05 have a courtesy hat so
00:49:08 for you for you to shoot a real movie
00:49:10 like that you have to have two nurses
00:49:12 doing culver tests
00:49:13 yeah they're gonna get better
00:49:18 they're hiring fucking out-of-work
00:49:20 actors to get certified online
00:49:24 then they put them on the set to to
00:49:27 hold the test and fucking you know
00:49:30 separated can't do that i pay dues
00:49:33 i want to fucking nurse that bitch yeah
00:49:36 you know
00:49:37 well it's the problem is if you catch it
00:49:41 and you are not healthy you don't have a
00:49:45 good immune system
00:49:46 you're older you're compromised maybe
00:49:48 you've got some sort of a condition
00:49:49 already
00:49:50 it's not good so the asking people to
00:49:53 work
00:49:55 where there's a one out of 10 chance
00:49:58 or one out of 20 chance or whatever the
00:50:00 number is that you might catch it that's
00:50:02 a new
00:50:02 ask that never was the question the
00:50:05 question was
00:50:06 hey do you want to work at ups i'm like
00:50:09 how much does it pay
00:50:10 what are the hours okay i'll do it it
00:50:12 wasn't like you might die
00:50:15 like you might catch this disease that
00:50:16 you die from it's not likely
00:50:18 but your everyone knows someone who at
00:50:20 least knows someone who died from it so
00:50:22 it's like fuck
00:50:24 how bad do i want this job or you could
00:50:26 stay home and take 600 bucks from the
00:50:28 government or whatever it is
00:50:30 most people are going to take they're
00:50:32 going to take that money you're going to
00:50:34 downsize your life
00:50:35 and just figure out a way to save money
00:50:37 because it's that
00:50:38 if you worked at a supermarket it used
00:50:40 to be you just worked at a supermarket
00:50:42 it didn't used to be you come in contact
00:50:44 with someone that might have something
00:50:45 that can kill you
00:50:46 and it's killing people not a lot not a
00:50:49 lot but that does not give you any
00:50:51 comfort when you're lying there with
00:50:52 tubes in your nose
00:50:53 if you're one of those people that gets
00:50:54 it and gets it real bad like michael yo
00:50:57 and you're in a hospital and you think
00:50:59 you might be going
00:51:01 michael yo jeffy gueron
00:51:04 frankie big balls and chris
00:51:08 was sitting in the green room together
00:51:10 that friday night
00:51:11 they all got it except chris he didn't
00:51:14 get it no
00:51:15 really jeffrey got it hospitalized big
00:51:17 ball
00:51:18 pete uh lisa benelli's ex great guy he
00:51:22 got it
00:51:23 i think he was hospitalized and
00:51:26 as his last blog i read from him he was
00:51:28 on oxygen treatment
00:51:30 jesus and michael yo got it michael you
00:51:33 was here months later and he said he was
00:51:35 still uh
00:51:36 struggling with fatigue so he looked
00:51:38 great
00:51:39 when i saw him he like if you saw him he
00:51:41 would think oh he's 100 recovered
00:51:43 like he looks like he's ready to go do a
00:51:44 triathlon but he said no
00:51:46 he said he still gets tired easy it's
00:51:49 not it doesn't feel the same
00:51:52 that's the fucking wood yeah this is
00:51:54 this is weird so
00:51:55 like i get it man i get people not
00:51:58 wanting to work
00:51:59 i fucking get it i'm not saying people
00:52:01 should go back to work i'm saying people
00:52:02 should have the option
00:52:04 and i know yeah everybody man everybody
00:52:07 should have the option
00:52:08 everybody should have the option this is
00:52:10 not a normal time it's not like
00:52:12 this is not a normal it's not a normal
00:52:14 scene
00:52:15 so if you don't want to work how much
00:52:17 does the government have to give you a
00:52:18 week
00:52:19 it's a good question this should be an
00:52:20 honest discussion that we should figure
00:52:22 out like how much money is there is your
00:52:23 right
00:52:23 to get paid yeah that's the rent thing
00:52:25 that's the red thing
00:52:27 you can't you can't just have people
00:52:29 broke like this for five months and not
00:52:31 even let them work this is what we're
00:52:32 seeing we're seeing people that are
00:52:33 there everyone has a hair trigger
00:52:35 everybody's ready to go off that's not
00:52:37 good for any of us
00:52:37 no no it's not a smile when you look at

00:53:44 i know that one of them might be the
00:53:45 vice president of the united states and
00:53:46 i think that fucking
00:53:48 uh trump won the election on saturday
00:53:50 when he gave people money because money
00:53:51 talks and bullshit walks
00:53:53 if i get a check in the mail from trump
00:53:55 after 600.
00:53:57 he bought my vote right the thing about
00:53:58 it is though i don't think
00:54:00 uh i think it relies on the state paying
00:54:02 25 percent in the state
00:54:04 california is bankrupt yeah like i'm
00:54:06 talking about the other day 50
00:54:08 he had me all scared of that well you
00:54:10 add up the state income tax
00:54:12 with the federal income tax it's it's in
00:54:14 the neighborhood of fifty four percent
00:54:15 absolutely with an increase
00:54:16 yes the increase that california wants
00:54:18 to do
00:54:20 look they they've tr they're trying to
00:54:21 figure out a way to buy the way out of
00:54:23 some of the problems
00:54:24 that we have i get it i don't know what
00:54:25 the fuck they should do
00:54:27 i'm a moron i shouldn't be the mayor or
00:54:29 the governor i am not going to do it
00:54:30 it's not
00:54:31 in my wheelhouse i would not balance the
00:54:33 budget i would not i'm not a pay
00:54:34 attentioner
00:54:36 it's not me man i got things to do i'm
00:54:38 worried about space
00:54:39 all right i'm not worried about your
00:54:40 budget but somebody has to do it they
00:54:43 have to do it right
00:54:44 and giving them more money it's not
00:54:46 gonna it's not gonna fix it they need a
00:54:47 fucking real plan
00:54:48 no one's telling us how to get out of
00:54:50 this economically no one's telling us
00:54:51 how to get out of this health-wise
00:54:53 everybody's bitching yeah this is the
00:54:55 first time we've been
00:54:57 caught with our pants i'm not mad at
00:55:00 anybody
00:55:00 i can't really be mad at anybody because
00:55:03 everybody got
00:55:04 caught with their pants down how we've
00:55:06 handled it at times
00:55:08 is kind of weird it's not just that it's
00:55:11 not just that we look vulnerable as a
00:55:12 nation
00:55:13 because we handled it stupid we
00:55:17 we had a big giant surge again it's like
00:55:20 we were
00:55:21 we were doing real well everything was
00:55:22 trending down and then we have a big
00:55:24 giant surge again now people are going
00:55:25 out
00:55:25 now places that weren't getting it or
00:55:28 getting it again
00:55:30 we didn't do such a good job it's not
00:55:32 you know the and the problem is if the
00:55:34 country's locked up
00:55:36 and we basically are a big percentage of
00:55:38 everybody's lockdown
00:55:39 and we're economically fucked and we're
00:55:42 scared to do things
00:55:43 so we're like probably not that healthy
00:55:44 we're not not as healthy as we normally
00:55:46 are
00:55:48 and there's not as much money and people
00:55:50 aren't working well well what
00:55:51 this is not a strong country then like
00:55:53 the country is only strong if
00:55:55 everything's strong
00:55:56 like the economy's strong the military's
00:55:57 strong the government's strong
00:55:59 when the economy is fucked and the
00:56:00 people are unhealthy
00:56:02 like that is that's the backbone of the
00:56:04 whole country this is a vulnerable
00:56:06 country
00:56:07 that's where it gets weird we don't ever
00:56:08 want to think that we're like oh we
00:56:09 don't have to worry about that anymore
00:56:11 but of course we do
00:56:12 that's history history is countries
00:56:14 taking over countries
00:56:15 history is countries figuring out a way
00:56:18 to dominate other countries
00:56:19 who knows what they're doing today to
00:56:21 each other i mean we hear about like
00:56:23 russian interference who knows what kind
00:56:24 of fucking viruses we have
00:56:26 oh that melon fucking thing is gonna be
00:56:28 a party and a half
00:56:30 that is the biggest scam in the fucking
00:56:32 world
00:56:33 that is the biggest fucking scam in the
00:56:35 world already the post office
00:56:37 is running fucking bind never mind all
00:56:40 those ballots that's a scam and a half
00:56:43 that's a scam and a half and it's
00:56:44 terrible i wonder what the best way to
00:56:46 do it is though
00:56:47 what if it turns out the post office is
00:56:49 the best way to do it like maybe it
00:56:50 takes
00:56:51 more time but maybe they're better out
00:56:53 oh bro you never want you never stuff
00:56:54 boxes
00:56:55 for 20 miles and look the other way no i
00:56:58 never stuffed boxes i started trying
00:57:00 to stuff boxes well i grew up in north
00:57:02 bergen new jersey
00:57:03 what do you mean by stuffed boxes i grew
00:57:04 up in north bergen new jersey
00:57:06 i was a cuban kid that stumbled upon a
00:57:08 fight one day and stuck up for an
00:57:10 italian kid and they made me part of
00:57:11 their family
00:57:13 but the other part of their family was
00:57:14 that they were political
00:57:16 and he was the other side of the wing
00:57:19 for politics remember there's a mayor
00:57:21 and he shows up with a guy like you
00:57:23 that's intelligent but then he
00:57:24 also has a guy like me and i do weird
00:57:27 things for him
00:57:28 i let people know what is what the man
00:57:31 wants done
00:57:32 yeah and i got to be very i was that
00:57:35 guy's son
00:57:36 ah i was his son i became his son then
00:57:39 his son
00:57:40 died and i really became his son so i
00:57:42 didn't know what i was doing he would
00:57:44 just go
00:57:45 go light this on fire put 50 dollars in
00:57:48 your pocket
00:57:49 and that's all i went and did you know
00:57:50 what i'm saying he told me to go pick up
00:57:53 this i wouldn't pick this up he told me
00:57:54 to go do this i still remember

01:00:54 you're like what kind of conversation is

01:00:57 yet but it seems like what happens if i
01:00:59 don't vote for this guy
01:01:01 bro one of the most interesting ones
01:01:02 that you've never watched but you should
01:01:04 read about
01:01:05 i think jamie has watched it's season
01:01:08 two of narcos
01:01:09 when they rigged the election in mexico
01:01:12 and they try to do it with the computer
01:01:13 and they get busted
01:01:15 and then they actually just sent narcos
01:01:17 to the fucking voting stations
01:01:20 they put a gun to your head and go put
01:01:22 another zero next to that number
01:01:24 whoa in 1987 the elections in mexico
01:01:29 were so fucking crooked because the
01:01:31 government that was coming in was gonna
01:01:33 side with the united states and that
01:01:35 could never happen
01:01:36 they were gonna lose millions of dollars
01:01:38 so that government had a win
01:01:41 and when you watch it play out in the
01:01:43 series you're like
01:01:45 but when you read about it you're like
01:01:47 what the fuck
01:01:49 they caught him red-handed it's like you
01:01:51 catching me taking this
01:01:53 and you going joey that's mine yeah bye
01:01:57 and walking out of here like it was that
01:01:58 cold-blooded of an election
01:02:00 the the fucking guy had to resign years
01:02:03 later but it was that brutal
01:02:06 because they figured they weren't going
01:02:08 to win the election in mexico city
01:02:10 so they went to all these farmer places
01:02:13 and all those motherfuckers got beat up
01:02:16 so forget about mexico city we're going
01:02:18 to lose mexico city it was what what's
01:02:20 the name of
01:02:21 the pera the the pra the pris an
01:02:25 organization
01:02:26 tremendous storyline on how they needed
01:02:30 that government to win
01:02:32 so they could keep getting drugs into
01:02:33 this country
01:02:35 and how the cia was even involved in
01:02:37 that election
01:02:38 but it was the narcos who went out to
01:02:40 the small villages
01:02:43 and fucking put guns to your head put a
01:02:45 zero on that number
01:02:47 it is one of the craziest things about
01:02:49 being an american
01:02:50 is that we're connected to a country
01:02:52 that's feeding us drugs and is
01:02:54 run by cartels and everybody's like
01:03:00 bro they had a town in mexico during
01:03:02 this that the cartel said if they saw
01:03:04 you on the streets without a face mask
01:03:06 they shoot you
01:03:08 hmm it was such a small village
01:03:11 yeah that it would have destroyed the
01:03:13 village so the narcos got involved and
01:03:15 said
01:03:16 if you go out without a face mask we'll
01:03:18 put a bullet you had
01:03:21 there's something about people who have
01:03:24 power
01:03:24 whether it's you're the mayor or the
01:03:26 governor or you're the narcos or you're
01:03:28 a cop
01:03:29 something about people having that kind
01:03:30 of power over your life like that with
01:03:31 just a finger on the trigger
01:03:33 it's too much for most people to handle
01:03:36 it's too much
01:03:37 most people can't handle it that's
01:03:40 that's what you're saying
01:03:40 most people should not have the ability
01:03:42 to just shoot you you can't shoot them
01:03:44 but they can shoot you
01:03:45 you don't listen they can shoot you if
01:03:47 you're running away they can shoot you
01:03:48 you come with them with a taser they can
01:03:50 shoot you
01:03:52 they need to like like make a freeze gun
01:03:54 we could just freeze them
01:03:56 that's not a bad idea nobody could
01:04:01 qualify for life until you're a fucking
01:04:03 cop
01:04:05 it's too hard to understand what that
01:04:06 job is understand entails
01:04:08 you know why i started going to jiu so i
01:04:12 could watch the ufc's and not feel
01:04:14 guilty
01:04:15 because i can't nothing bothers me more
01:04:17 when i see a blogger or an announcer
01:04:19 that's never done the jumping jack
01:04:22 and he's trying to cover the ufc nothing
01:04:25 bothers me more than that so
01:04:26 i want you to understand i grew up with
01:04:29 guys that were cops
01:04:31 i talked to them i saw how they had to
01:04:33 blow steam off because of the things
01:04:35 they saw
01:04:36 yeah they used their power they fucked
01:04:38 around they were all bad lieutenants if
01:04:40 you want to call it
01:04:42 but the job itself unless you're doing
01:04:46 it man
01:04:47 it's weird that's so weird it's a weird
01:04:50 job
01:04:51 you live in a different world than
01:04:52 everybody else do i appreciate police
01:04:54 listen i've been arrested how many times
01:04:56 i've been arrested
01:04:57 a million i never have been arrested a
01:04:59 million times i've never had a million
01:05:00 point one
01:05:01 never had a problem with a cop i even
01:05:03 had a cop pull over the chinese
01:05:04 restaurant one time and let me get food
01:05:06 handcuffed
01:05:07 because i hadn't you got good cops and
01:05:09 you're a good guy
01:05:11 number three i've never said the word
01:05:13 pig
01:05:14 on any podcast when i went to jail i

01:10:48 crazy narrative
01:10:51 i was tormenting these two cops but the
01:10:53 one cop wasn't going for it he didn't
01:10:55 like me personally

01:10:58 like him personally it's a movie
01:11:00 it was a fuck i let him know and i hated
01:11:03 him more than when he hated fucking me
01:11:06 that's what i did i let him know that i
01:11:08 hate him more and every time we went to
01:11:10 court he would sit there across from me
01:11:12 but i had a good attorney and it was
01:11:14 burning him up because he wanted me for
01:11:15 kidnapping
01:11:16 but i'm like not dawg you didn't find no
01:11:18 fingerprints on nothing
01:11:20 sorry charlie not this time so he was

01:19:36 people see
01:19:37 that there's a method of my fucking
01:19:39 madness okay so in those days felipe
01:19:42 espanza had a room willie barcelona had
01:19:44 a room
01:19:44 all those guys had bar rooms i knew in
01:19:47 those days that i had to prepare
01:19:50 two different sets i had to have my bar
01:19:53 set which was pretty basically dirty and
01:19:56 you had to go acapella because sometimes
01:19:59 you got to go up during the laker game
01:20:00 yeah you're not going to turn off a lego
01:20:02 game in orange county
01:20:04 they don't want they don't they love joe

01:20:09 yeah or she's not going to the bruins
01:20:11 back in boston
01:20:12 it's not going to happen so you got to
01:20:14 wait for the laker game to go on you
01:20:16 know
01:20:16 how many little george perez fly
01:20:20 i still shout those guys guys out rudy
01:20:22 moreno
01:20:23 all those guys had early gigs for us
01:20:27 that fed us gave you 50 60 bucks
01:20:31 and then you killed time you stopped at
01:20:34 king taco and then you got to the store
01:20:35 at 11.
01:20:37 joe would be at news radio until 10 30
01:20:40 rehearsing
01:20:42 you would show up late and that's when i
01:20:44 first met you you were still rehearsing
01:20:46 friday nights you would shoot on friday
01:20:48 nights and then
01:20:51 you would do this spot on friday night
01:20:52 and i would go on after you
01:20:54 and you won 11 30. that was not
01:20:57 10 45 days yet yeah you were still
01:21:00 getting a quarter to 12.
01:21:01 i was very lucky i didn't have a social
01:21:03 life so i could just do you know i
01:21:05 didn't have friends out here
01:21:06 so i would just do the show and then go
01:21:08 to the store
01:21:09 and then hang out with those guys i
01:21:11 didn't really know anybody yet
01:21:13 so it was good i got a lot of work done
01:21:15 but that
01:21:16 the thing about stand-up is what we had
01:21:19 at the store
01:21:20 that was really unusual was also what
01:21:22 you were talking about with tuesday
01:21:23 nights
01:21:24 it was a murderer's row in a way that
01:21:27 i've never seen before like every night
01:21:28 you would go there
01:21:29 it would be jaisalneck eliza
01:21:33 delia you nick schwarzen it was just
01:21:37 murderer after murder
01:21:40 ron
01:21:49 ian edwards owen smith
01:21:52 tom segura bird crusher bang bang
01:21:56 those lines were fucking death man you
01:21:59 would have come out
01:22:00 guns blazing and a lot of people got
01:22:02 upset at those lineups they're like i
01:22:03 can't get a spot i can't get a spot this
01:22:05 is fucked up and they get mad
01:22:06 you know i i feel like these people
01:22:08 don't respect me and there's like this
01:22:10 talk we need more women there was all
01:22:11 this talk we need more this we need more
01:22:13 that
01:22:13 the bottom line is that was a murderer's
01:22:17 road
01:22:17 it was so hard to find a spot because
01:22:20 what are you going to do you got santino
01:22:22 you got ian
01:22:23 n words you got all these people back to
01:22:24 back to back to back that are just
01:22:26 fucking killers
01:22:28 killer after killer where's the spotify
01:22:31 lighters
01:22:35 what is that from
01:22:42 you'd probably turn this volume down
01:22:44 here oh it's dead
01:22:46 what kind of whiskey is that by the way
01:22:47 i mean that's the coolest
01:22:53 this is buffalo trace is the first stuff
01:22:55 we had that you enjoyed and there's no
01:22:56 another stuff which i love warbringer
01:23:00 the war master edition this is josh
01:23:02 barnett's personal whiskey
01:23:12 how is it even possible to have lighters
01:23:14 in this fucking place that's crazy you
01:23:15 don't want to use the zippo either
01:23:17 you don't no because you get the uh the
01:23:19 the fumes from the zippo
01:23:21 juice i had a lighter how do we not have
01:23:23 i had something
01:23:24 i gave them to you to hide i think and i
01:23:26 don't know he's a good hider
01:23:28 look inside that skull probably they i
01:23:31 probably hit him so well i stole him
01:23:32 from myself
01:23:34 uh i know look in the skull maybe that's
01:23:37 the worst
01:23:38 force comes to worse i have one in my
01:23:39 car somewhere maybe go to your car
01:23:40 because this is
01:23:41 this is not happening
01:23:45 how crazy is we got to set red band out
01:23:47 to his fucking car
01:23:48 in order to get a lighter so i think
01:23:51 that's the first time you've ever handed
01:23:53 me breaking news
01:23:54 in the middle of a show it is very
01:23:56 important
01:23:57 breaking news the news of the uh i
01:24:00 i saw it literally within 45 seconds of
01:24:02 him tweeting it out
01:24:04 so i was like uh what do i do here maybe
01:24:06 she should be a great president
01:24:07 let's see let's just switch positions
01:24:17 people keep telling me dude he's not
01:24:19 there's nothing wrong with him he just
01:24:20 has a stutter
01:24:21 people keep saying that like everybody
01:24:23 at 78
01:24:24 is fucked everybody who's not fucked at
01:24:27 78
01:24:28 find me a guy find me a guy when i'm 78
01:24:31 don't take any of my advice
01:24:32 i probably won't know what i'm talking
01:24:34 about i'll probably be high as a kite oh
01:24:36 shit brian's got a lighter
01:24:38 when i'm 78 i'll be like tommy chong
01:24:41 high as a kite talking shit i love tommy
01:24:44 chong i love him too
01:24:49 um i've been doing comedy and virtual
01:24:52 reality and now it's the closest to
01:24:54 feeling like you're in front of people i
01:24:56 thought that makes sense
01:24:58 are you doing it like in a oculus or is
01:25:00 it a
01:25:01 valve index so it's like the best one
01:25:03 good uh refresh rate
01:25:05 can people record you yeah but i i live
01:25:09 streaming anyway so
01:25:10 oh there you go but it's cool to test
01:25:12 out new jokes because there's like 20
01:25:14 people there
01:25:15 and they laugh and they react they're
01:25:16 all like oh you know like spongebob's
01:25:18 excited
01:25:19 comedy is different with a small amount
01:25:21 of people there's like a there's a good
01:25:24 kind of comedy
01:25:25 that you can get out of a small amount
01:25:26 of people it's like you get an honest
01:25:27 comedy
01:25:29 because you can't put on like a stupid
01:25:31 show for three people
01:25:33 you have to like be you have to really
01:25:34 talk to them you know
01:25:36 yeah it's weird but you also don't get
01:25:38 those big bits
01:25:40 you're not going to develop big bits oh
01:25:41 no it's all tags it's all
01:25:43 tax it's all like new ideas and stuff
01:25:46 like that
01:25:46 sometimes you have good bits sometimes
01:25:48 bits come from that though
01:25:50 it depends really entirely on how fun
01:25:52 the people are the audience member
01:25:54 anybody says that it doesn't the
01:25:55 audience doesn't matter it's like it's
01:25:57 not the audience it's the comedian
01:25:58 you're fucking crazy
01:26:00 you're crazy of course it's the audience
01:26:02 too it's a bunch of people together it's
01:26:04 everybody
01:26:05 like every single interaction between
01:26:07 two people unless somebody comes up from
01:26:08 behind you and hits you in the head
01:26:10 involves you and them interacting
01:26:12 there's a bunch of
01:26:13 you know a lot of pieces in place if
01:26:15 there's a fucking
01:26:16 group of people and then you're telling
01:26:17 jokes of course it matters who the

01:26:51 them talking about all that stuff
01:26:53 like the old days and and like seeing
01:26:56 richard pryor on with betty davis like
01:26:59 they're smoking cigarettes while they're
01:27:00 playing it's wow so it's such an
01:27:02 interesting time capsule
01:27:04 that is yeah those days man them
01:27:06 bell-bottom stays
01:27:08 bell-bottoms and long collars people are
01:27:11 living different then
01:27:12 yeah i remember fucking watching let him
01:27:14 in an 82.
01:27:17 that was my thing when i first got
01:27:18 turned on to let him and a friend of
01:27:20 mine turned me on to let him
01:27:22 and i thought it was the greatest thing
01:27:24 ever who's the first comic you saw
01:27:27 live yeah
01:27:31 the first comic i listened to i can't
01:27:34 even fucking say the album
01:27:35 cover because i'll get in trouble i went
01:27:38 to my friend's house to listen to
01:27:41 the beatles and his brother was a junkie
01:27:45 and he came out of the room i was about
01:27:47 eight maybe nine and he came out of him
01:27:49 because what the
01:27:50 fuck kind of music is that shit
01:27:53 the fuck you listening to take that shit
01:27:55 off i'm like it's the beatles
01:27:58 he's like fuck the beatles and he put on
01:28:00 richard pryor
01:28:03 the crazy and my fucking
01:28:06 head went off a swivel joe rogan like it
01:28:08 just completely went off a swivel
01:28:11 i ran home to the bar and i worked my
01:28:13 mom for five
01:28:14 bucks when i went to the album store
01:28:16 albums were 4.99
01:28:18 you know and i would just so i had to
01:28:21 get that out
01:28:21 i went home and played it i would hide
01:28:24 it from my mother because you could put
01:28:25 the album down
01:28:27 and then put another album on top that
01:28:28 was gonna drop
01:28:30 so if your mom came in you automatically
01:28:32 dropped
01:28:33 so she couldn't hear and then i bought
01:28:36 bicentennial
01:28:38 and that put me over the top yeah now
01:28:41 there was no dream of me being a comic
01:28:43 at this time
01:28:45 i just thought the things he was saying
01:28:48 was so
01:28:48 fucking me like i wanted to be able to
01:28:51 talk like that i'm cuban
01:28:52 yeah i figured if i talked like that i
01:28:55 could influence motherfuckers and win
01:28:57 people over
01:28:58 because i had that little uh insecurity
01:29:01 about being an immigrant
01:29:03 but if i spoke like that and i could be
01:29:04 that funny
01:29:06 i could so i just started mimicking and
01:29:09 i would bring that out
01:29:10 to people's houses and the kids would be
01:29:12 ten and the mothers would catch us and
01:29:14 still today
01:29:15 there's a kid ray canelo his mother
01:29:18 still mad at me
01:29:19 for bringing over richard pryor there
01:29:21 were like three mothers that got mad at

01:34:33 santoria like that's it
01:34:35 i gotta call you godmother i can't
01:34:36 handle this no more
01:34:38 when i started dressing up like bruce
01:34:39 lee and i had incense in my room
01:34:42 and a bowl of rice
01:34:46 oh i had the outfit the white shirt that
01:34:48 you folded
01:34:49 i bowed there's quite a few dudes right
01:34:53 i fucking learned how to use chopsticks
01:34:55 my mother would go
01:34:56 that's it you got to go to your mother's
01:34:58 house you got a problem you're retarded
01:35:00 something's wrong with you
01:35:01 you're not chinese stupid you're not
01:35:03 chinese
01:35:04 and that would make up reasons why i was
01:35:06 chinese it used to be that you could you
01:35:08 could dress like you
01:35:10 did kung fu nobody would even say
01:35:12 anything they'd be like that guy's
01:35:13 really into the arts
01:35:14 you could walk around with them little
01:35:15 skinny tiny uh black
01:35:18 cloth shoes with a tiny like tan
01:35:21 heel remember those joey they're
01:35:23 basically slippers they were slippers
01:35:25 they're like kung fu slippers
01:35:26 and dudes wear white socks and we have
01:35:28 the full kung fu outfit on
01:35:30 and they just walk around the street
01:35:31 like that and you'll be like all right
01:35:34 what are you going to do and then yeah
01:35:36 there's the kung fu shoes
01:35:38 i had those dudes just walk around with
01:35:41 those men
01:35:42 they would walk around with those shoes
01:35:43 and it's just it's a nice shortcut
01:35:46 to like instantly you seem like a guy
01:35:49 who thinks of things in a different way
01:35:50 you seem spiritual you're in touch with
01:35:53 your chi and your energy
01:35:55 you can talk about chinese medicine you
01:35:57 can say a lot of stupid shit if you're
01:35:58 wearing
01:35:59 those slippers and some dumb kung fu
01:36:02 clothes i used to walk
01:36:03 around with this my girlfriend's making
01:36:05 me do this right now like having outdoor
01:36:06 slippers indoor slippers
01:36:08 and like slippers i can leave the house
01:36:10 with that's a good move just for your
01:36:11 health yep but have three different
01:36:12 slippers and
01:36:13 the problem is if you leave your shoes
01:36:15 on when you come in the house you're
01:36:16 tracking all kinds of
01:36:17 garbage from the outside that is
01:36:19 actually a good move sure we're going to
01:36:20 taste
01:36:21 the kung fu outfit not so much about
01:36:23 three weeks before my mother died
01:36:26 she would never be home on friday nights
01:36:29 because she was a degenerate gambler
01:36:31 so she would hit the tracks on friday
01:36:33 nights
01:36:34 but every once in a while she surprised
01:36:36 attacked me i'd have to use the visine

01:47:17 a date with marilyn monroe

01:47:21 out in 1993.
01:47:22 dude i have so much more respect for her

01:47:31 get in the limo bitch
01:47:34 no one would no one would have a problem
01:47:37 with it
01:47:38 no one would have a problem with it
01:47:40 everybody would have a problem with
01:47:41 everything we would all be laughing
01:47:42 though but if if
01:47:43 you know if like the biggest movie star
01:47:45 in the world was scooping up high school
01:47:47 seniors and blowing them
01:47:49 nobody would nobody get mad they would
01:47:51 say that's crazy i think that's
01:47:52 happening there was a gym teacher in my
01:47:54 school
01:47:55 that no one's at school right now there
01:47:56 was a female there was a female gym
01:47:58 teacher in my school

01:48:19 15 17. whoever's ready to party
01:48:22 everybody gave her a fucking stab
01:48:24 now dude everybody talk about it how
01:48:27 many people are
01:48:28 well known did the teachers know about
01:48:30 it or do the kids keep their mouth shut
01:48:34 cause that's the difference between
01:48:35 today i think she was giving pussy to
01:48:36 the teachers too
01:48:37 she ended up marrying one of the
01:48:39 teachers did she i don't i'm not sure
01:48:41 she was a hot blonde she was a hot
01:48:44 blonde
01:48:46 and then there was a chick in our high
01:48:48 school that just liked older guys
01:48:51 and i remember we were in summer school
01:48:54 and we were standing outside
01:48:55 and this chick was fucking hammered
01:48:59 she had to be 16 15 my age sophomore
01:49:03 summer
01:49:04 and right in front of everybody she just
01:49:06 went up to the vice principal hammond
01:49:08 and just started grabbing his dick and
01:49:10 going let's get out of here baby and
01:49:11 he's like
01:49:12 all right everybody could go play now
01:49:14 and
01:49:16 fuck it he's just froze i know the girl

01:49:21 today
01:49:23 really she's got kids yeah wow she got
01:49:26 kids the whole fucking deal and i talked
01:49:28 to her from time to time saying hello
01:49:30 that's hilarious
01:49:31 she was a freak when i was a kid there
01:49:33 was always a neighborhood freak
01:49:35 there was a neighborhood freak in my
01:49:36 neighborhood fucked all the kids that
01:49:37 played softball
01:49:40 she was hot she was 21. always had torn
01:49:42 jeans
01:49:43 they always knew a lot about rock they
01:49:46 always introduced you to some
01:49:47 old sabbath she'd play some old zeppelin
01:49:51 like i didn't know i i you know i was
01:49:53 musically illiterate at the point
01:49:55 i learned a lot about music from this
01:49:57 lady she's a nice lady does she smell
01:49:59 like cigarettes
01:50:00 oh yeah yeah yeah i thought it was hot
01:50:03 my street girl smelled like cigarettes i
01:50:04 thought it was hot i thought girls would
01:50:06 smell like like a woman that smelled
01:50:07 like she smoked cigarettes it was hot
01:50:09 this is like a dangerous lady
01:50:11 doesn't give a fuck about cancer
01:50:14 that's my rationale when i was a kid
01:50:18 i didn't i thought it was the dumbest
01:50:19 thing for you to do for your health but
01:50:21 i also thought it was hot
01:50:22 if girls smoke cigarettes i'll tell you
01:50:24 what the the how hard it was in my
01:50:26 neighborhood to score
01:50:28 that on facebook most of the kids on
01:50:30 friends were from my neighborhood
01:50:32 are married they married their high
01:50:34 school sweethearts
01:50:36 that's how anti-sex not anti-sex
01:50:40 but that's my high school was very
01:50:44 old-school old-fashioned it was very
01:50:46 old-fashioned yeah
01:50:47 high school sweetheart if you took a
01:50:48 spanish girl on a date you had to go
01:50:50 with a grandmother first three or four
01:50:51 nights
01:50:52 italian girls sometimes you got to bring
01:50:54 the whale you know the grandma with you
01:50:57 it was a different time i didn't learn
01:50:59 about sugar daddies and all that shit
01:51:01 i moved to seattle i heard all that
01:51:02 nonsense yeah
01:51:04 and then the shit that you hear once you
01:51:06 move here i've never been raised around
01:51:08 that shit i'm a criminal i don't know
01:51:09 nothing about that
01:51:10 fucking yeah islands and tom hanks
01:51:14 what the fuck what the fuck
01:51:18 oh and you hear this shit you know the
01:51:22 epstein
01:51:22 i don't know i don't know what to
01:51:23 believe i don't know but i don't think
01:51:25 tom hanks is a part of that
01:51:26 tom hanks thing is more or less an
01:51:28 internet meme it's like a joke that
01:51:30 they're they're pretending that tom
01:51:31 hanks the pedophile
01:51:32 but the uh i've seen things real that's
01:51:35 that's what's crazy it's like there's so
01:51:37 much talk
01:51:37 about all these other things when
01:51:39 there's
01:51:41 there's a whole log of people that went
01:51:43 to this island
01:51:45 with a guy who was a pedophile who was
01:51:46 known for having underage girls
01:51:48 and he didn't really kill himself and
01:51:51 everybody knows it so
01:51:52 everybody knows somebody what's the over
01:51:55 i took the over that they're gonna bomb
01:51:56 that place where they have it
01:51:58 they can't they can't choke her no they
01:52:00 can't choke and they can't
01:52:02 suicide so there's either going to be
01:52:04 some type of
01:52:06 disruption corona some type of
01:52:08 disruption
01:52:09 corona some a heavy dose of corona
01:52:13 well that was one of the things i talked
01:52:14 to oliver stone about with jack ruby you
01:52:16 said that jack ruby getting cancer and
01:52:17 dying so quickly
01:52:19 like that didn't really make sense that
01:52:21 they were working on things that you
01:52:22 could do to people where you could
01:52:24 inject them and they'd get cancer and
01:52:25 die
01:52:27 yeah yeah corona there's either who
01:52:30 knows
01:52:31 it's gonna be interesting to see what
01:52:32 happens it's gonna blow her out of there
01:52:33 if
01:52:34 she has to testify the fucking marines
01:52:37 got to go
01:52:38 yeah the marines got to go e-bike
01:52:40 accident
01:52:41 [Laughter]
01:52:43 like poor simon
01:52:46 broke his back what he was on though
01:52:48 like i have two e-bikes i'm addicted to
01:52:50 that lifestyle but what he was on
01:52:52 is is like a motorbike it's like a tron
01:52:55 motorcycle that's has like the torque of
01:52:58 a tesla you know
01:52:59 no it's like he was on one of those one
01:53:01 of those what's he doing
01:53:03 uh i don't know i think uh no helmet
01:53:06 i think it's fun it's like having a test
01:53:08 as a bike and
01:53:09 but is it a is it a motorcycle or is it
01:53:12 a scooter do you need a license
01:53:13 classified yeah instead of like a
01:53:16 motorbike like x game style it's just
01:53:18 uh a battery when we were in austin i
01:53:21 was watching those drunk fucks
01:53:22 roll by on those scooters i was like do
01:53:24 you need a license for that you should
01:53:26 have a fucking
01:53:26 license these guys are going kind of
01:53:28 fast you do you're supposed to you why'd
01:53:30 you when you sign up for the thing
01:53:31 you're supposed to like take a picture
01:53:32 of your id and
01:53:33 if you fall going 15 miles an hour you
01:53:35 are
01:53:36 fucked like i don't know if you realize
01:53:37 how fucked you are if you fall on
01:53:38 concrete and you're going 15 miles an
01:53:40 hour you're fucked one of mine goes 38.
01:53:43 38. yeah and it's just like yeah jamie's
01:53:46 got a crazy one you got to know how to
01:53:47 fall
01:53:48 listen bitch you're hitting the concrete
01:53:50 and electric poles it hurts
01:53:52 oh my god stop you don't understand if
01:53:55 you hit something at 30 miles an hour
01:53:56 that's way different than okay let's say
01:53:58 15. something at 15 miles an hour you
01:54:01 hit the concrete
01:54:02 and a pole at 15 miles an hour you have
01:54:04 no understanding of what you would weigh
01:54:06 with 200 pounds the ones you rent off
01:54:08 the street
01:54:09 have a limp they're limited to only go
01:54:10 like 13 miles an hour or something like
01:54:12 that if you hit a pole at 13 miles an
01:54:14 hour
01:54:14 listen to me jamie you're gonna get
01:54:17 fucked up
01:54:18 you're gonna get fucked up like really
01:54:20 fucked up that's full sprint i know
01:54:22 i get it but i'm saying like you if
01:54:25 you're just walking around
01:54:26 it's not nearly well you don't but other
01:54:28 folks are intoxicated you're very well
01:54:30 coordinated
01:54:31 but i'm saying it's kind of crazy you
01:54:32 could just pick one of these things up
01:54:33 with no license
01:54:35 and you're going 15 miles an hour poking
01:54:36 down the streets these are the ones that
01:54:38 you these are the ones you rent on the
01:54:39 street
01:54:40 you're supposed to have a license you
01:54:41 have to have a license whether or not
01:54:43 you do it without like you can give it
01:54:44 to your kid but like as you sign up for
01:54:47 it
01:54:47 you're live you're giving a liability
01:54:49 like you take a picture of your license
01:54:51 oh okay so you have to have a driver's
01:54:52 license yeah yeah yeah okay
01:54:54 not buying them that's better yeah
01:54:55 that's to buy it that's better but but
01:54:57 it's definitely more complicated than
01:54:58 driving a car right like you got a
01:55:00 balance on that thing
01:55:02 a bike you but if someone's a slob
01:55:06 right it's not hard but it's a sloth
01:55:08 balance if someone just has no
01:55:10 coordination
01:55:10 it's just like i get on one of those
01:55:12 things it's just a bike that scooter
01:55:14 oh scooter those scooters that are
01:55:16 everywhere yeah i don't like the
01:55:17 scooters you can go fast
01:55:18 yeah you can go as fast there's scooters
01:55:20 that go 45 miles an hour that you could
01:55:22 buy
01:55:22 come on you can't do that you need a
01:55:24 helmet where's your fucking helmet
01:55:26 you definitely you're going 40 miles an
01:55:27 hour where's your helmet

01:58:53 sophisticated tunnel in u.s
01:58:55 history discovered between mexico and
01:58:58 arizona
01:58:59 although it's not exactly clear what the
01:59:01 structure was intended for
01:59:02 it had ventilation a rail system and
01:59:05 extensive reinforcement
01:59:07 yeah look at that shit dude that's how
01:59:09 the vampires come in
01:59:10 that's how they got el chapo out you
01:59:12 ever see that the el chapo one's amazing
01:59:15 el chapo goes to take a shit and never
01:59:16 returns he goes behind this little thing
01:59:19 he's the only thing that keeps the
01:59:20 camera from seeing him taking a shit is
01:59:22 a thing
01:59:22 where he can't see him when he's sitting
01:59:24 so it's like a thing about this high
01:59:26 so he turns around towards where the
01:59:27 toilet is ducks down and disappears
01:59:29 forever from sight
01:59:31 like he's like taking a shit for like
01:59:32 five hours to go in and check on the guy

01:59:37 there with a rail system
01:59:39 like a real rail system and lighting and
01:59:40 electricity goes a mile long

01:59:48 people in the jail can realize he's gone
01:59:50 he's a mile away he pops out of this
01:59:52 building

01:59:55 swoop him up in a truck or whatever
01:59:57 a helicopter and they they get them the
01:59:58 fuck out of there but it's hilarious

02:03:06 leave me alone with tom hardy tom hardy
02:03:08 was good with gandalfini
02:03:09 that's the best thing fucking tom hardy
02:03:11 did that and the fucking bronsons
02:03:14 what christian bale is fucking the real
02:03:16 deal you gotta rock with christian bale
02:03:19 but the dude who fucking does
02:03:24 narcos mexico the little dude
02:03:27 that dude is on a different level
02:03:31 he's on a different level he takes that
02:03:32 show to a different level
02:03:34 you can't take your eyes off him and i
02:03:36 didn't even know that this latin
02:03:38 theater existed when i was a kid i
02:03:40 watched telemundo
02:03:42 and telenovelas that's the gay one he's
02:03:45 tremendous
02:03:46 that's the gay one that's the sick
02:03:48 that's when they're in cali cartel
02:03:50 this is all good stuff
02:03:54 but the guy narcos mexico
02:03:58 he's so fucking good it's scary
02:04:01 how good he is he does two seasons
02:04:05 he's the one that that one and i saw he
02:04:08 tells the story of
02:04:10 what happened in new york we were brown
02:04:13 we were
02:04:13 buying brown weed and all of a sudden
02:04:16 they were selling a wheat called since
02:04:18 emilia
02:04:19 and it was a weed that was grown with no
02:04:22 seeds
02:04:23 so it was easier to pack and easier to
02:04:25 smuggle
02:04:26 so they had to convince these people
02:04:29 that this was the future
02:04:30 but there's a problem with sensomia it
02:04:33 has to be grown in the desert it can't
02:04:34 be grown anywhere else
02:04:36 because a male plant will fuck up the
02:04:38 whole thing
02:04:39 so it's got to be grown in the desert
02:04:41 who grows weed in the desert
02:04:43 these motherfuckers set up an irrigation
02:04:45 thing explain the male
02:04:47 female plant thing i don't you know i
02:04:49 don't know not now but jamie
02:04:51 when he gets a minute when jason i know
02:04:54 it i know it's a thing like
02:04:55 hermaphrodites or something
02:04:56 they can't switch but yeah they they can
02:04:58 switch genders but the flowery ones are
02:05:01 the females
02:05:02 right like marijuana you want to make
02:05:04 sure that they're female and you
02:05:05 make sure the males don't fuck them over
02:05:07 and switch them yeah i don't know how
02:05:09 to get too close and change each other
02:05:11 can you see the biggest
02:05:13 crop seeds from narcos i mean so
02:05:15 marijuana grows
02:05:16 transphobic these motherfuckers
02:05:20 mint seeds are actually look at the size
02:05:22 of this
02:05:23 fucking this went on for days where they
02:05:27 just grew this weed
02:05:29 and they would do it right before do you
02:05:32 know how to grow weed
02:05:33 no every time i do it i fail
02:05:36 but this they show you how damn
02:05:40 they show you how look at that look at
02:05:43 the size of those
02:05:44 guys how did netflix pull this off what
02:05:46 do they do it's brilliant do you think
02:05:48 that's all cgi
02:05:49 a lot of cgi mixed with fake some plants
02:05:52 like some real
02:05:53 you can have real plants they're legal
02:05:54 now well they're probably just plastic
02:05:56 but this guy defines the system this guy
02:05:59 devised the system
02:06:01 that he knew that there was water in the
02:06:03 desert
02:06:04 and that's where they grew this weed
02:06:07 and the only this kid here he could eat
02:06:10 motherfuckers alive for breakfast with
02:06:11 his acting
02:06:13 that dude dad that little mexican right
02:06:14 there and i
02:06:16 watched him a couple times and i go
02:06:17 there's something special about this kid
02:06:19 i'm not gonna look him up or whatever
02:06:22 and i finally looked him up his mother
02:06:24 died when he was three
02:06:25 and his father was a stagehand in mexico
02:06:28 so his father was a set designer
02:06:30 which means that he grew up around his
02:06:32 father on the set designing
02:06:34 which made him a little bit more
02:06:35 creative than the average fucking kid
02:06:37 he was also in star wars this kid will
02:06:40 eat motherfuckers up for lunch
02:06:43 he's gonna eat motherfuckers up for
02:06:45 lunch
02:06:46 when they let him go they just narcos
02:06:49 was his shit
02:06:50 he was that good diego luna that fucking
02:06:53 good joe rogan
02:06:55 steals it and so he does even one
02:06:57 episode
02:06:58 when he tells his wife i don't need you
02:07:01 anymore
02:07:02 you could go whoa cold-blooded and how
02:07:06 he does it the whole
02:07:08 from a to z from a to z how he started
02:07:11 with weed first
02:07:13 and then he went on a mission to do a
02:07:17 favor and he saw cocaine
02:07:19 in nicaragua and he goes all the cocaine
02:07:22 is stuck in nicaragua
02:07:24 why is it sucking nicaragua because they
02:07:26 had closed the roots
02:07:27 from miami so he went uh
02:07:31 he went to fucking cali cartel they told
02:07:34 them you got two choices
02:07:36 you got the cali cartel the legit
02:07:39 they don't even look like drug dealers
02:07:41 but then we got another guy
02:07:43 that's very emotional
02:07:47 so you have to pick who you want to go
02:07:49 with
02:07:50 he went with the businessman cut a deal
02:07:54 on the way to the airport they get
02:07:56 kidnapped
02:07:57 they take them right to pablo's house oh
02:07:59 jesus it is one of the greatest fucking
02:08:01 scenes
02:08:02 ever when how pablo talks to him he says
02:08:06 what did you are you doing here i went
02:08:08 to cali
02:08:09 pablo lights up a fucking joint pablo
02:08:13 was talking to him he went to cali okay
02:08:16 he go and then he goes what are you
02:08:17 gonna do with a hippopotamus pablo had a
02:08:19 hippopotamus
02:08:21 pablo's telling him like he loves
02:08:23 hippopotamuses because they're smooth
02:08:25 and all this shit
02:08:26 the whole time he's just smoking a joint
02:08:29 because i'm gonna cut your deal
02:08:31 for every load you take of this you take
02:08:34 one of mine in
02:08:37 and that's how that whole thing goes oh
02:08:40 the guy agreed to it so and the guy
02:08:41 agreed smart yeah agreed
02:08:43 to reload because don't be greedy bitch
02:08:45 he goes because if you do that for me
02:08:47 then you're gonna put me out of business
02:08:48 do you think that narcos is like the
02:08:50 rocky movies for drug dealers
02:08:52 like this it's very sad you know what
02:08:54 narcos the first two
02:08:56 the first two seasons the first two
02:08:58 seasons or three seasons of narcos
02:09:00 is very sad for a guy like me really
02:09:02 because it shows you the truth of what
02:09:04 happened
02:09:05 it shows you that the colombians had
02:09:08 something going on and once the
02:09:10 americans saw the amount of money
02:09:12 they tapped right into it right that
02:09:14 whole thing with barry seal
02:09:15 and arkansas and that's all real we
02:09:18 can't rewrite that it's like
02:09:20 the first time you realized that kennedy
02:09:22 hit was done by the c.i.a
02:09:24 or whoever did it right you said to
02:09:26 yourself wow we have a government that
02:09:28 isis their own people right
02:09:29 now they fucking help bring in these
02:09:32 drugs the same war on drugs that they
02:09:34 have on paper
02:09:36 they're profiting off and then when you
02:09:39 look at the fucking weed thing
02:09:41 from the narcos perspective it was
02:09:44 you you don't know the amounts of weed
02:09:46 they were bringing in
02:09:48 they were supplying the whole country
02:09:49 with green weed
02:09:51 the whole country would censor me
02:09:55 damn and everybody was in on it
02:10:00 but meanwhile reagan is on there with
02:10:03 his wife
02:10:03 just saying no yeah so
02:10:06 you see the hypocrisy and it kind of
02:10:08 hurts you you go what the fuck else
02:10:11 won't they do you know well the just
02:10:13 saying no thing
02:10:14 was coming from the same administration
02:10:17 that funded the
02:10:18 the conscience versus the sandinistas
02:10:20 with cia drug money
02:10:22 run through south central l.a they show
02:10:24 him through freeway ricky ross
02:10:26 who's been on the podcast twice yes they
02:10:28 show him the real
02:10:30 frogs yeah they show narcos the mexican
02:10:33 kid i just told you
02:10:35 they show him going because the plane
02:10:36 goes down he's in them how they
02:10:38 discovered that whole thing was
02:10:40 a plane goes down ah and all of a sudden

02:10:44 north
02:10:45 oliver south whatever your fucking name

02:10:49 well guess what happened narco
02:10:52 went to the c.i.a after they had killed
02:10:55 kiki camarena
02:10:57 he's the most wanted man in the fucking

02:15:47 genius
02:15:48 this kid got the island he made them a
02:15:51 bunch of money
02:15:52 but then he started doing a podcast from
02:15:55 the island
02:15:56 with cameras and naked women what of him
02:15:58 snorting coke with a robot how old was
02:16:00 he
02:16:01 who the fuck knows 28 30 just making

02:16:11 bags of blow behind you
02:16:13 he's just ripping bags open snorting
02:16:15 them just talking he was a john lennon
02:16:18 fan
02:16:19 so he would talk about coming today is
02:16:22 he would do these videos for hours for
02:16:25 days
02:16:26 so he was like an original youtube star
02:16:28 yeah so what they did was but he wasn't
02:16:30 posting on youtube
02:16:31 he was like he did so what they did was
02:16:34 myspace boy he's the first one they gave
02:16:36 up
02:16:38 when the shit got deep and the
02:16:39 colombians were in trouble
02:16:41 the five colombians sat down they said
02:16:43 listen this kid's on an island talking
02:16:46 about jim morrison in the doors
02:16:48 let's let him let's let the feds know
02:16:50 where he's at
02:16:52 we'll give him you and we got no beef
02:16:55 so they actually died and laid there
02:16:57 they gave him
02:17:00 two thousand years oh my god look up the
02:17:02 sentence i'm not trying to be funny
02:17:05 they gave him a thousand so why would
02:17:06 they extradite him to germany because he
02:17:08 gave them information years later about
02:17:11 he gave them he gave them like vital he
02:17:14 gave them
02:17:14 really great information that if the
02:17:17 country fucking knew
02:17:19 we would sink like he gave him shit
02:17:23 he gave them information that he was he
02:17:26 also not beside having his
02:17:28 island that that was also a
02:17:32 a distraction his main contributor his
02:17:35 main
02:17:36 supplier was fidel so he
02:17:39 fidel was letting him go to cuba bring
02:17:42 the coke to cuba stock it and for every
02:17:44 ship that went out from cuba to the
02:17:46 united states
02:17:47 with a cuban flag fidel would get a
02:17:50 kickback of 800
02:17:51 000 fidel was sending three four ships a
02:17:54 day
02:17:57 so he testified against fidel which
02:18:00 obviously nobody ever arrested fidel and
02:18:03 he told them everything he knew about
02:18:05 the ins and outs of money moving
02:18:08 you could find it online all the shit he
02:18:10 had done
02:18:11 this guy in blow is based off that guy

02:21:17 what's it called
02:21:19 cyber trucks no no no no the the gas the
02:21:21 ford bronco
02:21:23 no yeah i have a real bronco i have a
02:21:26 1972 bronco yeah
02:21:28 those are real i have mine's a manual it
02:21:31 doesn't even have good brakes
02:21:33 those there's a thing about broncos like
02:21:36 like those old broncos even mine like i
02:21:38 have a coyote engine in it it's like a
02:21:40 it's icon so uh jonathan ward makes it
02:21:43 it's a they take a uh
02:21:45 an eight-cylinder mustang engine like
02:21:47 for if you bought a mustang gt and they
02:21:49 put that in an old bronco and
02:21:51 tweak everything but it's still not
02:21:53 really fast it's not supposed to be fast
02:21:55 it's just supposed to be interesting
02:21:57 it's like you're driving this thing it's
02:21:58 like all mechanical and shit
02:22:01 but the new broncos not going to be like
02:22:03 that new bronco is going to be dope
02:22:05 no doubt about it but it's going to be a
02:22:06 different kind of dope it's going to be
02:22:07 like a modern dope what is that again
02:22:09 show me what we
02:22:10 put it's interesting uh larger cyber
02:22:13 truck will be north american ass kicker
02:22:15 smaller cyber truck highly likely and to
02:22:18 be sent to countries we hate
02:22:20 you know why right north american ass
02:22:22 kicker the the size of the cyber truck
02:22:24 like elon wanted to make it smaller
02:22:26 because it's
02:22:26 bigger than what a average sized garage
02:22:29 is single
02:22:30 car garage oh and so that's the problem
02:22:32 that's why there's probably going to be
02:22:33 a smaller one
02:22:34 that is a fucking problem yeah we are
02:22:37 gross
02:22:38 we do need things to be as big as
02:22:40 humanly possible
02:22:41 if there's a fucking xl diet coke i
02:22:44 always get it
02:22:45 i i'm like the regular large is not
02:22:47 enough i am
02:22:48 thirsty americans are greedy you know we
02:22:52 see a bigger truck if there's a
02:22:53 like like samsung has it nailed right
02:22:56 they sell you the regular note
02:22:57 and then you can get the note ultra

02:25:43 google right that's it

02:26:22 this is there was a moment in the main
02:26:24 room i don't know if you remember this
02:26:26 but this was like many years ago we're
02:26:28 talking about like
02:26:29 2001 maybe maybe around then maybe 2
02:26:32 000 there was no one in the main room
02:26:35 you're on stage
02:26:36 and you had danny play black sabbath war
02:26:39 pig
02:26:40 i took my shirt do you remember that
02:26:41 yeah do you remember you had danny play
02:26:43 war pig and you took your shirt off 15
02:26:45 fucking years ago and you were singing
02:26:47 into the microphone
02:26:49 and we were like yes because it was
02:26:52 it was there was no audience no there
02:26:54 was 10 people yeah there was 10 people
02:26:56 but there was also 10 comedians
02:26:58 so there was 20 people in the audience
02:26:59 in the main room 10 of them were just
02:27:00 audience members
02:27:02 and then joey's on stage he gets the
02:27:03 spotlight on him and
02:27:05 he's fucking singing it not just like
02:27:07 not lip-syncing
02:27:08 he's fucking singing at the top of his
02:27:10 lungs to war
02:27:11 pigs and we're we're all like yes
02:27:14 it was what the comedy store is it was
02:27:17 the madness
02:27:18 it was sink or swim it was chaos it was
02:27:22 there's 10 people the audience what are
02:27:23 you gonna do
02:27:24 jose diaz what are you gonna do you took
02:27:27 your fucking shirt off
02:27:29 and you started singing into the
02:27:31 microphone full clip
02:27:33 and we were cheering the audience was
02:27:35 cheering because we recognized that you
02:27:37 did something fun
02:27:38 you did something special you took a
02:27:39 moment a fucking 12
02:27:41 45 spot in the main room on whatever
02:27:44 night it was i don't remember it was
02:27:45 only weekends
02:27:46 back in those days the main room was
02:27:47 only open on weekends so it happened
02:27:49 today
02:27:49 fridays and saturdays yeah so it had to
02:27:52 be it was most likely friday or saturday
02:27:54 but it was late everybody was gone and
02:27:57 you just took control of this moment in
02:27:59 this way that i never i'm never gonna
02:28:00 forget
02:28:01 because it was positive it was it was
02:28:03 exciting and it made me realize what
02:28:05 part of what live comedy is it's it's
02:28:08 not just like
02:28:09 set up punchline it's not there's
02:28:11 moments where you capture these moments
02:28:13 since you just knew how to
02:28:15 you know how to grab a hold of that
02:28:17 fucking wave and
02:28:18 ride it you were just hating that wave
02:28:21 of love you were just riding it
02:28:22 i've been obsessed especially when i
02:28:26 started watching youtube
02:28:28 why youtube got into comedy and i
02:28:31 followed
02:28:32 comedy but then i looked at it
02:28:34 differently
02:28:35 when youtube hit i started studying
02:28:38 singers i started studying singers
02:28:42 to really learn how to really get
02:28:46 my message across so i started with
02:28:49 robert plant
02:28:51 nobody gets the message across like
02:28:53 robert plant
02:28:55 when he's singing since i've been loving
02:28:56 you okay you have to study the great
02:28:59 singers
02:29:00 i studied the singer from bad company
02:29:04 his body movements then i studied the
02:29:07 singer from
02:29:09 leonard skinner so i copied i stole
02:29:13 leonard skynyrd's that dude whatever his
02:29:16 name was when you see joey diaz on stage
02:29:18 i'm just faking it i stole
02:29:22 leonard skynyrd singer's persona
02:29:25 on stage the persona is that walk
02:29:28 that he makes in oakland in the 77
02:29:32 the walk of james brown onto africa
02:29:36 with the cape which they took the cape
02:29:39 off
02:29:40 me and you laughed about it yes yes once
02:29:42 you
02:29:43 take that side of music and you mix it
02:29:46 with what we're trying to do
02:29:48 and implement it at the comedy store is
02:29:51 when your life really explodes as a
02:29:53 comedian
02:29:54 that just dennison touched into it this
02:29:56 little thing you touched into it yes
02:29:59 look at him that show's amazing he
02:30:01 doesn't give a fuck
02:30:02 you don't you cannot give a fuck so i
02:30:05 studied what
02:30:06 you know just a couple of singers have
02:30:10 this joe rogan
02:30:12 that you could tell what they're singing
02:30:14 about by looking at their body
02:30:16 robert plant since i've been loving you
02:30:19 live from the garden
02:30:21 is fucking body language
02:30:24 is superb but nobody's body language
02:30:27 was better on stage than fucking robert
02:30:30 plant
02:30:31 mick jagger did his thing but
02:30:34 selling you what three guys behind you
02:30:38 are playing
02:30:39 is a gift that i also wanted to tap into
02:30:42 that's why i kind of liked josh's idea
02:30:46 if you didn't do it you missed out as a
02:30:48 comic
02:30:49 can you imagine what would happen if i
02:30:51 said no to it for months and i did it
02:30:54 it was the worst anxiety attack i ever
02:30:56 got
02:30:57 but it was worth doing it one time john
02:31:00 rogan what were you going to say i'm
02:31:01 sorry
02:31:01 no you imagine if leonard skinner didn't
02:31:03 crash in that plane
02:31:05 we would have had a complete different
02:31:06 world today the outlaws would have been
02:31:08 huge
02:31:09 because leonard skinner was already
02:31:11 blowing ted nugent out of the water on
02:31:13 tour on that tour
02:31:14 it was well known those those songs were
02:31:17 so good
02:31:18 i know a little i know a little about
02:31:20 love maybe i can guess the rest
02:31:22 you have no idea you have no idea dude
02:31:25 to this day man
02:31:27 when i do my kickboxing boxing workouts
02:31:29 nine out of ten times
02:31:30 i put on a leonard skinner it gets you
02:31:32 angry yeah i put it on the playlist yeah
02:31:34 yeah but it's just it's just they
02:31:36 weren't supposed to be that good
02:31:38 they're from florida for real they're
02:31:41 not supposed that that's the story of
02:31:43 leonard skynyrd they're not supposed to
02:31:44 be that good ronnie vanzant all those
02:31:46 guys they're from
02:31:47 florida they were powerful bro in a way
02:31:50 in a weird way
02:31:51 in a weird way they would rehearse their
02:31:53 rifts right
02:31:55 like eddie bravo was explaining to me
02:31:57 like the the difference in like some
02:31:58 like some people
02:31:59 have riffs where they just go off like
02:32:02 some guys just shred
02:32:03 and some guys have riffs where the whole
02:32:05 riff is like this
02:32:06 really calculated solo
02:32:10 it's not as simple as like a guy just
02:32:12 fucking wow
02:32:14 for the crowd now this guy's got a whole
02:32:17 like
02:32:17 when they did like if they did uh
02:32:21 free bird they that that one guitar solo
02:32:27 might be the greatest guitar solo of all
02:32:29 time
02:32:30 it was so polished because it's a crazy
02:32:32 solo
02:32:33 because they they did that solo over and
02:32:35 over and over and over and over again
02:32:37 fuck it was good man when he hits the
02:32:39 leap when he leaps in the air
02:32:41 and slams down on the good side here

02:41:10 and then pick a street and make a left
02:41:13 so you can make another left to get on
02:41:14 the one-on-one
02:41:16 and make a mental projection of when
02:41:18 this will come back
02:41:22 but you know what everybody wanted the
02:41:24 zombie apocalypse
02:41:26 you got it bitch you know what i'm
02:41:27 saying you want everybody ha ha ha ha
02:41:30 zombie it's pretty close
02:41:34 well everybody wanted society to burn so
02:41:36 so many people wanted society to burn
02:41:38 i just don't think they expected it to
02:41:40 burn this way they just didn't want
02:41:42 the current system to be in place they
02:41:44 wanted a more equitable system
02:41:47 but this is uh this is what happens when
02:41:48 there's a breakdown when it's a
02:41:50 breakdown we go back to who we were
02:41:52 just a few thousand years ago like this
02:41:54 is why it's so important for
02:41:56 civilization to be maintained it's not
02:41:58 just because
02:41:59 you know it uh it helps rich people
02:42:02 protect their money and helps people
02:42:04 feel safe
02:42:04 it helps everybody grow you're in a bad
02:42:08 state if you've got violence everywhere
02:42:10 because people can adapt
02:42:12 to whatever state they're in if they
02:42:13 just get become accustomed to having
02:42:15 violence all the time everywhere
02:42:17 is going to be a much more dangerous
02:42:19 place with the same people
02:42:21 same people living in it and two years
02:42:23 later it's a far more dangerous place
02:42:25 that's for whatever reason whatever
02:42:27 causes people to lean one way or another
02:42:29 like that that's not a good sign
02:42:31 that's a sign of a very shaky
02:42:32 civilization and i think that uh
02:42:35 we can lean one way or the other here we
02:42:37 could either lean
02:42:38 to where we fight more and was more
02:42:39 violence more chaos more destruction
02:42:41 more people angry
02:42:43 or if we can calm the fuck down and
02:42:45 figure out a way to
02:42:46 work through shit together as human
02:42:47 beings we're the same people that
02:42:49 lived in this this this planet two years
02:42:52 ago when everything was amazing
02:42:53 with the same people yeah there was
02:42:55 always problems on this planet
02:42:57 but when here you are two years later
02:42:59 it's the same human beings
02:43:00 we're just confronted with a problem we
02:43:02 didn't expect and we didn't do a good
02:43:04 job hitting it
02:43:05 we fucked it up and we we have to figure
02:43:07 out how to do it right
02:43:08 but we have to also figure out how to
02:43:10 maintain the goddamn economy
02:43:11 you have to have both you can't just
02:43:13 have one thing you have to figure out a
02:43:15 way where people can work for safe in a
02:43:17 safe way
02:43:18 it's possible it's got to be possible
02:43:19 what would you do different than
02:43:21 garcinia
02:43:22 gavin i'm a moron what would you do i'm
02:43:25 not the guy that you would come to
02:43:26 that's going to tell you how to run a
02:43:28 city but i would say you have to realize
02:43:30 there's a ratio and there's a ratio of
02:43:33 like if people hit a certain amount of
02:43:35 poverty
02:43:36 and despair they will covet
02:43:39 if they hit a certain amount of despair
02:43:41 and unemployment
02:43:42 there's a there's a statistic you could
02:43:45 actually find out like
02:43:46 they've done studies you you see it's a
02:43:49 correlation between the amount of
02:43:50 suicides
02:43:51 the amount of drug addicts the amount of
02:43:52 people who commit crime
02:43:54 they're all connected people have no
02:43:56 choice they have no way out
02:43:57 and that's what a lot of that this is so
02:44:01 we had they look they focused on one
02:44:03 kind of life
02:44:04 loss and that's the life loss loss of
02:44:05 the disease but they didn't focus on the
02:44:08 life loss
02:44:09 loss to the economy collapsing or to
02:44:11 people
02:44:12 being able unable to pay for their bills
02:44:15 and get depressed or suicidal or drug
02:44:18 addicts
02:44:19 they didn't factor that too you have to
02:44:21 factor all that shit in
02:44:22 they didn't do that they only factored
02:44:24 the one thing which was you don't want
02:44:26 people to die of the disease
02:44:28 how do we make sure that the hospitals
02:44:30 aren't overstaffed how how do we make
02:44:32 sure that people can get or overloaded
02:44:34 rather how do we make sure that
02:44:36 people can work safely and they didn't
02:44:38 do a good job of that
02:44:40 but nobody did nobody in america did
02:44:42 they never were prepared for something
02:44:44 they weren't prepared they had no idea
02:44:46 how could they we were not prepared
02:44:48 and that's why you can't point a finger
02:44:49 at anybody and i'm not apologizing for
02:44:51 them either
02:44:52 because there's probably somebody like
02:44:53 bill gates or something like that who
02:44:54 saw it coming
02:44:55 a while ago and he would have done a
02:44:57 much better job of if you put him in
02:44:59 charge of setting something like that
02:45:00 that up and protecting people from
02:45:02 pandemics and this is how much money you
02:45:04 need to hit any sort of problem
02:45:06 if it happens if you don't you're not
02:45:07 going to be able to contain it if you
02:45:09 don't contain it it's going to spread
02:45:10 you're like this is an investment you
02:45:12 have to make if you like laid it out to
02:45:13 people in that way
02:45:14 who fucking knows man that shit might
02:45:16 work it might have worked
02:45:18 they might have been able to if not
02:45:20 prevent this maybe slow it down
02:45:22 but even new zealand just has new cases
02:45:24 new zealand had no cases for a hundred
02:45:26 days
02:45:27 and now they have cases really i thought
02:45:28 i just read they didn't i believe it's
02:45:30 today
02:45:31 i believe today they found some new
02:45:32 cases still
02:45:34 this shit is crazy contagious it's crazy
02:45:37 contagious
02:45:38 it's weird
02:45:42 well you know what shit four new cases
02:45:45 shout out to dana white for the bubble
02:45:47 on one house i guess he came
02:45:48 up with this shit how did he get him on
02:45:50 it
02:45:51 no i don't think football is gonna work
02:45:53 it's crazy and that's gonna devastate
02:45:55 whoever would have saw this coming seven
02:45:57 months ago nobody
02:45:58 nobody saw this coming crazy nobody just
02:46:01 was so
02:46:02 tense have you noticed everyone's so
02:46:05 tense it's a huge reset though it might
02:46:08 i mean it's going to be interesting to
02:46:09 see what's on the other side of this
02:46:11 you know reset it might be put more
02:46:13 positive it might be not
02:46:14 but i i feel like
02:46:18 whenever things are really bad like you
02:46:21 know with riots or with
02:46:22 looting or with craziness i feel like at
02:46:24 the end
02:46:25 the other end of it people usually take
02:46:27 a deep breath
02:46:28 and they try to figure out okay what's
02:46:30 the solution it's getting through the
02:46:32 crazy part where people want to smash
02:46:34 windows and burn things and
02:46:36 you get if we can get through that and
02:46:39 get to the point where
02:46:40 rational people from both sides are
02:46:42 talking the problem is
02:46:44 a lot of other people have jumped in
02:46:45 that aren't rational and they want it
02:46:47 all to burn down
02:46:48 and you know their life's not so great
02:46:50 anyway so they'd be happy to set this
02:46:52 federal building on fire fuck you my dad
02:46:55 hates me fuck you
02:46:56 you know there's a lot of that out there
02:46:58 you got to be real careful with
02:46:59 like who you give a license to light a
02:47:01 building on fire
02:47:02 like who are they doing it on behalf is
02:47:04 that the wisest way to handle our
02:47:05 resources
02:47:06 would it be better if we just like
02:47:08 chanted sang songs
02:47:09 maybe like uh stated our argument no
02:47:12 somebody
02:47:13 so many people want to light things on
02:47:14 fire why because they become a part of
02:47:16 any
02:47:17 like if you have a if you have like a
02:47:18 legitimate cause it's a really good
02:47:20 cause but a bunch of idiots jump in
02:47:22 and they start fucking it up like that's
02:47:24 what happens with people
02:47:25 if you just have a cause where anybody
02:47:27 can join and it's one of the most
02:47:28 pivotal things
02:47:29 it's on the news every day and everyone
02:47:32 every day
02:47:33 is fixated on it of course you're going
02:47:36 to get attention whores in there
02:47:37 there's a tension horse in every single
02:47:40 walk of life
02:47:41 you're going to get attention wars as
02:47:43 activists there's going to be some
02:47:44 activists that ruin it for all the other
02:47:46 ones
02:47:46 the other ones that were out there
02:47:47 really just want things to change
02:47:49 they're really tired of people getting
02:47:50 shot by cops they're really tired of
02:47:53 injustice they really are and then
02:47:55 there's people that are crazy
02:47:56 they want to hit people with bike locks
02:47:58 light buildings on fire they're there
02:48:00 too
02:48:00 that's a problem the problem is we're
02:48:02 all individuals
02:48:03 whenever we jump into groups like that
02:48:06 based on some sort of ideology
02:48:08 there's gonna be people on your team
02:48:09 that you're not gonna agree with you're
02:48:11 stuck with their decisions you're stuck
02:48:12 with what they do
02:48:13 and then everybody digs their fucking
02:48:15 heels in everybody wants to be either
02:48:17 left wing or right way
02:48:18 you're the winners are against us you're
02:48:19 red or blue come on son
02:48:22 it's it's like message board 101. it's
02:48:24 dumb
02:48:25 there's always a couple people you're
02:48:27 like all right it's dumb
02:48:30 there should be no president there
02:48:31 should be a bunch of people that are in
02:48:33 charge of different jobs
02:48:35 it should be like the president of
02:48:36 finance the president of war
02:48:39 the president of agriculture the
02:48:41 president of the environment someone who
02:48:43 only knows that one discipline
02:48:45 do you think trump really has any idea
02:48:47 what the fuck they're doing when they're
02:48:48 fracking
02:48:50 do you think he's paying attention to
02:48:52 what happens in people's water wells
02:48:54 they're like their toilet bowl is on
02:48:55 fire no one knows why
02:48:57 come on man can you imagine if you lived
02:48:59 in one of those fracking places and you
02:49:00 took a shit and it was awful
02:49:02 so you lit a match and you threw it into
02:49:04 your bowl hoping you know you would like
02:49:06 kill some of the smell of your horrible
02:49:07 shit
02:49:08 and then the match hits the fucking bowl
02:49:09 and lights on fire because your water's
02:49:11 flammable
02:49:12 because they're fracking that's real
02:49:15 that's totally possible
02:49:19 do you think trump knows about that
02:49:20 there's no way he knows about that he's
02:49:22 got a hundred different hotels with his
02:49:24 name on them
02:49:24 they have giant gold letters like that's
02:49:26 what i like that's what i'm looking for
02:49:28 he's not paying attention to what's
02:49:30 happened to people that are fracking he
02:49:32 has
02:49:32 no interest no one can you can only
02:49:34 think of so many things man
02:49:36 is fracking what caused that earthquake
02:49:38 in north carolina
02:49:40 it's causing earthquakes everywhere the
02:49:42 number of earthquakes
02:49:44 since fracking let's let's before i talk
02:49:46 shit what's the fucking use bro
02:49:48 science fracking let's find out it's
02:49:49 what percentage of um
02:49:51 increase in earthquake activity what is
02:49:55 it
02:49:55 drilling for oil pretty much right yeah
02:49:58 yeah yeah it's basically they're
02:50:00 drilling into it's a more complicated
02:50:02 way of drilling but through this
02:50:04 they've liberated so much oil that we're
02:50:06 not as dependent on if we aren't
02:50:08 dependent anymore
02:50:09 on international oil they've been able
02:50:12 to suck a lot of it out of the ground
02:50:13 but for people that live there
02:50:15 it's horrific there's a guy named is it
02:50:18 josh fox who has that book gasland
02:50:20 or a documentary gas land i believe
02:50:22 that's his name
02:50:24 uh he he he's been on here before about
02:50:27 it which
02:50:28 this is from inside science for maybe a
02:50:30 year what does that say there were you
02:50:32 highlighted
02:50:32 i didn't highlight it's just weirdly
02:50:34 highlighted already even in western
02:50:36 canada
02:50:36 only about one in 300 fracking
02:50:39 operations causes earthquakes oh no big
02:50:40 deal
02:50:41 300 large enough for a person to feel in
02:50:44 north america at the moment
02:50:46 imagine how funny that is hey man
02:50:48 seriously we only cause
02:50:50 one earthquake for every 300.
02:50:54 we're changing the earth only one out of
02:50:56 three they don't tell you how many
02:50:57 fracking operations they have
02:50:59 what if they have like 300 a day across
02:51:00 3 000 different holes in the ground
02:51:02 which seems like that makes actual sense
02:51:04 it's probably something high like that
02:51:06 yeah dude you know people have these
02:51:08 ranches
02:51:09 out in these places and then they they
02:51:11 have these things set up on these
02:51:12 ranches where they'll
02:51:13 they'll frack and dig into the ground
02:51:15 and good luck if you have like a water
02:51:18 source that's connected to that
02:51:19 apparently
02:51:20 and sometimes the gas gets out of the
02:51:22 ground it fucks up the air quality and
02:51:26 bro that gets dark they aren't just
02:51:29 small quakes
02:51:30 although fracturing related earthquakes
02:51:33 are chronic
02:51:34 they were thought to be minor but new
02:51:36 research is showing they could be quite
02:51:37 large and damaging
02:51:38 the focus of the study of a 5.7
02:51:41 magnitude quake near
02:51:42 prague oklahoma damaged 14 homes
02:51:46 and other structures in the area imagine
02:51:48 you're in prague
02:51:49 oklahoma you're like at least i can just
02:51:51 sit on the porch and relax
02:51:53 we're away from most folks
02:51:56 and these fracking motherfuckers they
02:51:59 chewed up the ground
02:52:00 under your house like the government has
02:52:02 to decide like how deep
02:52:03 under your house is this still your
02:52:04 house like if you buy a
02:52:06 pot of land and they drink your
02:52:08 milkshake
02:52:11 you remember that from that movie let
02:52:12 there be blood he's like i drank your
02:52:15 milkshake
02:52:16 do you remember that you remember what

02:52:44 exactly this is daniel day lewis
02:52:48 explaining to this guy
02:52:49 how he drinks his milkshake he's
02:52:52 explaining to this guy how he puts his
02:52:53 pipes
02:52:54 underneath this dude's land and he
02:52:55 drinks his milkshake and
02:52:57 nothing you could do about it it's like
02:52:59 it's weird there's a num
02:53:00 you know i don't know how far under your
02:53:08 house
02:53:10 i paid him ten thousand dollars cash you
02:53:13 can't play it
02:53:13 you've got that motion plus shit still
02:53:15 on your your tvs guys that
02:53:17 setting that makes it look like a a soap
02:53:19 opera does it
02:53:20 yeah both of your tvs have that where it
02:53:22 stabilizes
02:53:24 the shake of a natural camera so now it
02:53:26 looks like a soap opera
02:53:27 youtube on youtube uh no your tv
02:53:29 settings on both of these tvs have
02:53:31 your motion plus uh turned on do you
02:53:33 notice that
02:53:34 no watch videos yeah it looks normal to
02:53:38 me
02:53:38 really it looks like a soap opera to you
02:53:40 yeah the it's like got that creepy look
02:53:42 where it
02:53:43 looks like there's no jiggle in the
02:53:44 camera and everyone it's like there's
02:53:46 just tripods everywhere
02:53:47 really yeah i would have never noticed
02:53:50 i didn't point it out i know what you're
02:53:52 talking about but i don't see it oh i
02:53:53 see it huh
02:53:55 interesting hate it so much that is the
02:53:57 nerdiest video talking ever
02:54:00 it's one of the worst things ever man it
02:54:02 drives me crazy i hate it so i don't
02:54:03 even notice it
02:54:04 it's like you know how most tv shows
02:54:06 have like a little like
02:54:08 like you're holding a camera like a
02:54:09 realistic kind of like breathing of uh
02:54:12 of somebody filming it right when the
02:54:14 motion plus
02:54:15 fixes all that it makes it so it looks
02:54:16 like it's just on a tripod and somebody
02:54:18 hit record in the recording somebody
02:54:20 sitting there it's called the
02:54:21 soap opera effect uh so it just looks
02:54:23 like a cheap camera
02:54:24 most tvs have it turned on to begin with
02:54:26 because tv companies think that looks
02:54:28 better and people want that but when i
02:54:30 see it
02:54:30 i i i i get shit that's so panicky
02:54:34 i've never even heard of that or i mean
02:54:37 i have heard of it
02:54:38 but i never thought of it auto motion
02:54:40 plus is a motion smoothing feature that
02:54:42 eliminates ghosting and blurring
02:54:43 that occurs from fast moving images this
02:54:46 looks great on live tv like sporting
02:54:48 events or parades which are filmed at 30
02:54:50 frames per second
02:54:51 that's from samsung saying that maybe
02:54:54 it's just better for sports though
02:54:55 maybe it actually is better for sports i
02:54:57 mean because most sports are not
02:55:00 handheld you know it's like overhead
02:55:02 stuff
02:55:03 but it doesn't does it affect like how
02:55:04 it looks when things are moving fast
02:55:06 like if people are sprinting or
02:55:07 something probably because it's it's
02:55:09 it's it's not there's no jiggle to it
02:55:11 you know but it already doesn't have
02:55:12 jiggle to begin with so it's
02:55:14 sure so would it be better to do it that
02:55:15 way with movies
02:55:17 but the way with the emotions shit with
02:55:20 like fights and things like that
02:55:21 fights probably not but like football
02:55:23 and baseball or
02:55:24 something like that something that's
02:55:26 stationary cameras for the most part

03:00:57 hard yeah you know there's guys that you
03:00:59 know a lot of people are going down hard
03:01:01 yeah we're going to go out there like
03:01:03 fucking gang busters
03:01:05 well i just when do you think it's gonna
03:01:06 happen april
03:01:08 that's what i would say april so
03:01:11 they come up with some kind of a vaccine
03:01:14 right now they're saying january
03:01:16 but they're saying january and they're
03:01:18 winking at you
03:01:19 yeah it's by the time everyone gets
03:01:22 around getting it and everything i'd say
03:01:24 april also do you guys think they should
03:01:26 let people work
03:01:28 depends what type of job they're doing
03:01:30 yeah that they social distance you know
03:01:32 what
03:01:33 i love i'm a fat fuck i don't go there
03:01:37 but uh that burger joint
03:01:42 um yeah in and out social distancing in
03:01:45 that
03:01:46 i just ate there the other day
03:01:48 distancing
03:01:49 those four feet do they make people wear
03:01:51 masks inside there masks and gloves and
03:01:53 they really try their best
03:01:55 but there's jobs that you just can i
03:01:58 went to get my hair cut done
03:02:00 for that that week that it was open it
03:02:02 was the
03:02:03 i thought the safest i've ever been
03:02:05 eating
03:02:07 they're fucking the hair people right
03:02:09 now isn't it true that california is the
03:02:11 only state
03:02:11 like is that true california is the only
03:02:14 state that doesn't let hairdressers open
03:02:15 i saw that map i don't know
03:02:16 yeah is that true though i retweeted
03:02:18 that map i didn't even check and they
03:02:19 said that they only do it outside you
03:02:21 can't have a sink out so you can't cut
03:02:22 hair and windy outside shit
03:02:24 like it's the dumbest idea and then what
03:02:26 happens when it gets dark you gotta stop
03:02:29 and otherwise you can stay open till
03:02:30 eight nine at night and if they try to
03:02:32 do it in their
03:02:32 house they can't do you know a shield
03:02:37 so you have to have your hand through
03:02:38 the shield dip them in the water and
03:02:41 then they spread them
03:02:42 and then you have to have the thing you
03:02:44 know hey listen you ain't stopping
03:02:46 the vietnamese and fucking orange county
03:02:48 yeah they're the ones that built those
03:02:50 tunnels for the mexicans
03:02:51 they don't fucking stop those vietnamese
03:02:54 from orange county they're
03:02:56 opening shop they don't give a fuck
03:02:58 there's been what about the dudes in
03:03:00 jersey they threw in jail
03:03:02 we're opening up the gym oh yeah
03:03:05 they're hitting them with some crazy
03:03:06 fines like fifteen thousand dollars a
03:03:08 day
03:03:09 they're gonna lose their license it says
03:03:11 you can get a haircut outside
03:03:12 as of july 20th 29th yeah
03:03:16 but no one's doing that right but what
03:03:19 and my and my friends do hair out here
03:03:22 they said that they can't even like have
03:03:23 you come to their house because if they
03:03:25 find out the hair association they'll
03:03:27 pull their license the question though
03:03:29 was is california the only state that
03:03:31 bans
03:03:33 doesn't it
03:03:37 doesn't but then again right if you're
03:03:40 if you're someone who's fucking you can
03:03:43 make 600 bucks from the government or
03:03:45 you can take a risk of getting some
03:03:47 disease that might kill you
03:03:48 to clean someone's nails yeah but the
03:03:51 problem is from what i'm hearing is a
03:03:52 lot of people are not getting any
03:03:54 checks like they got one big one and
03:03:56 then they haven't heard anything for
03:03:57 months you can't call anybody you can't
03:03:59 get anything so it's like i have to pay
03:04:01 rent so
03:04:02 what am i going to do exactly i do i i
03:04:05 feel you 100
03:04:07 i don't have like when i look at this
03:04:09 there's i don't have a clear way out of
03:04:10 this
03:04:11 because i feel like if everybody just
03:04:13 went back to work more masks
03:04:15 how much quicker would the disease
03:04:16 spread people are working
03:04:18 like they used to be working side by
03:04:20 side with people just wearing masks how
03:04:21 much would it stop that
03:04:23 i don't know what does that look like i
03:04:26 mean is the only reason why there's not
03:04:28 a fucking heap more dead bodies because
03:04:30 we killed the economy i don't know man
03:04:33 i'm too
03:04:33 stupid i like to think that's the way
03:04:36 reason
03:04:36 you know like it seems like that makes
03:04:38 sense
03:04:40 my worry is that they like telling
03:04:42 people what to do that's my worry people
03:04:44 like telling people what to do they love
03:04:45 it
03:04:46 stay inside do this do that wear a red
03:04:49 flag
03:04:50 you know wear a blue t-shirt people love
03:04:53 getting people to comply with everything
03:04:56 and if all of a sudden they have this
03:04:57 power to keep you from
03:04:58 comply with anything well i didn't have
03:05:00 to okay i got lucky
03:05:02 near did i but a lot of people did i go
03:05:03 to parties no no did i go to the park no
03:05:06 do want do i need to go to a bar not

03:12:29 tremendous that's a tremendous god damn
03:12:31 what a good fucking movie that was oh
03:12:33 great just to talk to you
03:12:35 there he is that's amazing
03:12:42 he's playing with your fingers i'm gonna
03:12:44 have to end this podcast
03:12:53 well i hope you're wrong about april but
03:12:55 whenever it is
03:12:56 we'll we'll be more appreciative i think
03:12:58 can an alligator survive
03:13:00 uh without eating yeah for a long time i
03:13:02 heard it they could never die from
03:13:04 starvation
03:13:05 is that real i don't know i know they
03:13:07 know that for sure
03:13:08 crocodiles have gone without eating for
03:13:10 a whole year what's with the crocodile
03:13:12 questions
03:13:13 somebody told me that i can't stop
03:13:14 thinking about it it's a solid question
03:13:16 because what if they don't starve death
03:13:17 they just shrink right and i also heard
03:13:19 lobsters but i heard that was fake
03:13:21 that lobsters don't have to eat oh
03:13:25 dude yeah that makes sense if you until
03:13:28 you like shrink
03:13:29 if you don't have enough food you get
03:13:30 down to like nothing right and then
03:13:32 you're down to one cell
03:13:34 wow that's interesting bro and just
03:13:36 shrink with cells
03:13:37 here it is they only can be killed by
03:13:39 starvation or accidents it says
03:13:41 crocodiles have no recognized finite
03:13:44 lifespan
03:13:45 instead they just get bigger and bigger
03:13:47 until they inevitably
03:13:48 they're inevitably killed out by
03:13:50 starvation accidents or disease
03:13:53 this is the reason we don't see
03:13:54 crocodiles the size of boeing 747s in
03:13:57 the wild
03:13:57 so if there was an unlimited amount of
03:14:00 food they would live forever and no
03:14:02 disease
03:14:02 we vaccinated crocodiles and gave them
03:14:05 an unlimited amount of food then there'd
03:14:07 be dinosaurs
03:14:08 they're basically dinosaurs didn't we
03:14:10 figure that out the other day that
03:14:12 crocodiles are as old as some dinosaurs
03:14:15 like dinosaurs
03:14:16 were like 65 million years ago but
03:14:18 crocodiles go back to like 100 million
03:14:20 years
03:14:20 wasn't that what it was so they're pre
03:14:23 they're dinosaurs
03:14:24 they're just still around they're just
03:14:25 hungry dinosaurs have you seen an
03:14:27 alligator in real life
03:14:28 yeah it's so confusing it's like why is
03:14:31 it right there
03:14:32 and why is everybody not freaking out 80
03:14:35 million years
03:14:36 so there you go wow so that's 15 million
03:14:39 years
03:14:39 older than when the asteroid hit and
03:14:41 killed everything
03:14:42 so they're fucking dinosaurs
03:14:46 dude i remember seeing one for the first
03:14:47 time is at lake alice
03:14:49 it's in gainesville florida my dad was
03:14:51 going to school in gainesville
03:14:52 we were down there and uh went to this
03:14:55 lake you throw marshmallows in the water
03:14:56 and alligators come and get it
03:14:58 i was like this is the strangest shit in
03:14:59 the world there's a 10-foot lizard just
03:15:01 ate a marshmallow in front of me
03:15:03 and i'm i'm not even worried about it
03:15:04 like when in
03:15:06 the world is a fucking giant dinosaur
03:15:08 like
03:15:09 feet in front of you and you're not
03:15:10 freaking out like
03:15:12 crocodiles were too mean they became too
03:15:15 dangerous and no one wanted them around
03:15:17 but alligators looked like crocodiles
03:15:19 but they're just
03:15:20 chill enough that people don't freak out
03:15:23 too much if they're around
03:15:24 that was their trick that's how they
03:15:25 stayed alive they just moved slower
03:15:28 moved slower and didn't attack as much
03:15:30 but they're fucking everywhere man
03:15:32 if you live in florida you've got
03:15:34 alligators in your yard all the time
03:15:36 like people want to live in florida like
03:15:38 okay that's there's alligators out there
03:15:39 there's
03:15:40 a florida video of the day a baby
03:15:42 alligator and a bobcat duking it out
03:15:44 kind of going viral so i can't put it up

03:18:32 that one sandwich that was the rib
03:18:34 maker and they
03:18:46 why do they ever take it off the menu if
03:18:48 people like it so much because they
03:18:49 limited time only because they mean it's
03:18:52 it's uh yeah they don't have
03:18:53 indonesia it's only it's like in season
03:18:56 it comes via woohead with a fucking bat
03:18:59 on it
03:18:59 okay i was hoping it was like
03:19:04 they can only buy a large amount of
03:19:05 media uh not they can't buy it all the
03:19:07 time frequently
03:19:08 it's permanent on the menu in germany
03:19:11 so head over there yeah they don't like
03:19:14 manipulation over there
03:19:15 first thing down the menu all year
03:19:19 what are you doing you're manipulating
03:19:21 people's desires
03:19:23 [Laughter]
03:19:27 i don't think so they don't even allow
03:19:28 scientology in germany
03:19:30 good they won't allow them they're like
03:19:32 excuse me
03:19:33 what are you saying you're saying that
03:19:35 the guy who writes the science fiction
03:19:37 books
03:19:38 comes up with the best religion and you
03:19:41 don't want to pay taxes
03:19:42 that might be the worst german accent of
03:19:44 all time conspiracies about why it's not
03:19:46 on the menu all the time so
03:19:48 it's a deep debated topic probably
03:19:50 because it fucking
03:19:51 kills you it probably kills you they
03:19:53 probably know that if they give it to
03:19:54 people 40 days as well they just start
03:19:56 dropping down
03:19:57 so they're like listen just just give
03:19:59 them 20 days of mcrib
03:20:02 problem solved if they if they buy
03:20:05 if they buy 20 days of big ribs then
03:20:07 they die the 36th
03:20:09 day there's no way they can connect us

03:28:25 boy that's a tough one because
03:28:28 everybody's yelling
03:28:29 listen i want to go to church but church
03:28:32 is where your heart is anyway yeah
03:28:34 so enough with the church is where your
03:28:36 heart is but they need to make a
03:28:38 solution so i understand you have to go
03:28:39 and see and sing and dance but you know
03:28:42 what for right now
03:28:43 for right what's going on right now i
03:28:46 don't know what's in the
03:28:47 the constitution i don't know what's in
03:28:49 the federation
03:28:50 i don't know i'm just saying that for
03:28:52 right now if you want to have the
03:28:54 congregation
03:28:54 anything over eight people you're
03:28:56 playing with fire and even over six
03:28:58 people
03:28:59 but even then unless you know who those
03:29:01 where those people are they're living
03:29:02 with you fine
03:29:03 but if you don't know italy they should
03:29:06 figure out a way to do it outside
03:29:07 my friend who's a pastor in ohio does it
03:29:09 outside every sunday
03:29:10 totally could be done in a park yeah
03:29:12 they can do it you can do it outside
03:29:13 until it gets really cold out
03:29:16 yeah and then you're fucking cold then
03:29:17 you gotta get a bonfire going
03:29:19 yeah then it's jesus bonfire every
03:29:21 sunday yeah that sucks right

00:00:00 [Laughter]
00:00:09 all day
00:00:10 [Music]
00:00:13 hello miley cyrus how are pleasure to
00:00:16 meet you
00:00:16 you also i'm happy to be here i'm happy
00:00:18 to have you here you have a fantastic
00:00:20 voice
00:00:21 not just a singing voice but you're
00:00:22 talking voice it's very unusual it's
00:00:24 like it makes you step back a little
00:00:25 like oh
00:00:26 i've actually uh recently i was walking
00:00:28 around in boston i went to a museum and
00:00:31 this like
00:00:32 older man walked up to me i had no idea
00:00:34 who i was he was just enjoying the art
00:00:36 also in the museum
00:00:37 and started talking me forever about my
00:00:39 voice and my
00:00:40 and then there was a college some sort
00:00:42 of
00:00:43 trip to the museum and then everybody
00:00:45 started freaking out
00:00:46 and it was so cool just to have someone
00:00:48 stop me about my speaking voice because
00:00:49 that had never happened to me before i
00:00:51 think as i was turned around and
00:00:53 i have the mullet so i could have been
00:00:54 you know anybody i could have been
00:00:57 anyone it's a heavy voice it's a heavy
00:00:59 voice
00:01:00 um you didn't always have a heavy voice
00:01:02 though like when my kids love hannah
00:01:03 montana by the way yeah
00:01:05 so when i i would watch your voice was
00:01:07 different
00:01:08 it's definitely changed i actually i
00:01:10 kind of learned a lot about
00:01:12 the voice and how our experiences
00:01:16 affect our voice i had a surgery in
00:01:18 november on my voice
00:01:20 i had something called reiki's edema
00:01:22 which when my doctor told me about it
00:01:25 he said no one shy ever has this this is
00:01:27 for abuse
00:01:28 of the voice this is for people that
00:01:30 talk way too fucking much and usually
00:01:33 this happens when you're like in your
00:01:34 60s or 70s how do i not have that
00:01:37 i don't know i don't know mine i think
00:01:39 honestly
00:01:40 really i started touring you know at
00:01:43 probably 12 or 13 and not only was i the
00:01:46 adrenaline that you have after a show
00:01:48 it's not really the singing that affects
00:01:50 your voice as much it's afterwards
00:01:52 you're totally on and then it's really
00:01:54 hard to get that sleep you stay up
00:01:55 talking all night later the talking all
00:01:57 night
00:01:58 turned into smoking all night and now
00:02:00 this is kind of where we're at
00:02:02 we got some dirt on her you know she the
00:02:05 voice can be like like a face it
00:02:06 collects
00:02:07 wrinkles and and it tells a story if you
00:02:09 look at yourself and you go oh i didn't
00:02:11 have this until this
00:02:12 this trip you know i sat out in the sun
00:02:13 or i partied too much or whatever your
00:02:15 voice says the same thing it collects
00:02:16 dirt
00:02:17 it's very distinctive yeah yes it gives
00:02:20 me away
00:02:20 um i mean i'm pretty much one of the
00:02:22 only chicks in l.a with a mullet
00:02:24 so that gives me a way also well you're
00:02:26 not in the right neighborhood there's
00:02:27 plenty
00:02:28 i know i gotta drive out to the to the
00:02:29 desert i guess yeah that's right yeah
00:02:32 yeah go out to joshua tree yeah exactly
00:02:33 find the chicks that are tripping
00:02:35 exactly yeah with handmade tattoos i
00:02:37 have a couple of those too
00:02:40 but there's something very distinctive
00:02:41 about a voice you earned
00:02:43 you know it's true it's kind of like you
00:02:45 know when you see somebody and
00:02:46 and i think i think especially being
00:02:49 like a female in the industry i think
00:02:50 growing up and changing and like kind of
00:02:52 that
00:02:54 there is such a kind of stigma with
00:02:55 aging it's a very kind of scary thing as
00:02:57 a female in the industry
00:02:58 and um i thought about it a lot and
00:03:01 thought about my voice i actually had
00:03:02 someone when i was doing an interview
00:03:04 a couple months ago said you know she
00:03:05 sounds like she stayed up
00:03:07 all night smoking too many darts and i
00:03:09 said well i fucking have
00:03:10 um and that's just the truth and if you
00:03:12 know that was anyone else you know it's
00:03:14 kind of like you're weathered or your
00:03:15 age or you've been through it and
00:03:17 you know we'll talk about it as we go
00:03:19 but they're they're
00:03:20 over the last year i noticed a really
00:03:22 big change in my voice kind of a
00:03:23 heaviness to it
00:03:25 and i experienced some heavy things and
00:03:27 so i feel like it
00:03:28 is a reflection it is kind of a scar in
00:03:31 a sense
00:03:32 um but also just by having the surgery
00:03:34 was kind of a gift also because
00:03:36 i was able to understand my instrument
00:03:38 no one ever explained that to me you
00:03:39 know i sat in a room with the piano and
00:03:41 did scales and shit but no one taught me
00:03:43 about
00:03:44 how do you have longevity you know you
00:03:46 are in here with athletes all the time
00:03:47 and and recovery days are the most
00:03:49 important days
00:03:50 um i didn't get recovery days there that
00:03:53 was not important for someone that was
00:03:56 making so much capital for such a big
00:03:57 corporation you know the off days are
00:04:00 days that that money's not coming in and
00:04:02 i i definitely
00:04:03 probably didn't get the training that i
00:04:05 needed to say hey you know what i don't
00:04:07 want to do this till i'm 15. i want to
00:04:08 do this till i'm 80
00:04:10 and that wasn't always considered
00:04:12 definitely not complaining it gave me an
00:04:14 amazing launch pad for everything i'm
00:04:16 doing now but
00:04:17 i hear it but it had to be really odd to
00:04:20 be working that much
00:04:21 and be a young girl the balance
00:04:25 it trained me to have is something that
00:04:27 i don't think you are gonna get taught
00:04:29 any other way besides jumping in the
00:04:31 deep end of the pool and hoping you know
00:04:33 how to swim that's the only way
00:04:34 i there was no way i could have prepared
00:04:37 for the amount of
00:04:39 balance i would have to learn to kind of
00:04:41 teeter because
00:04:43 you know at one point again it went from
00:04:45 it was school
00:04:46 then it went from you know how many how
00:04:50 much we can
00:04:50 actually smoke and still play a teenage
00:04:52 superstar on the disney channel
00:04:54 and then like and then like what's the
00:04:56 answer to that question
00:04:58 more than you would fucking think um i
00:05:01 remember one time when
00:05:03 and i don't smoke anymore and i'm sober
00:05:06 how long have you been sober but i i've
00:05:07 been sober since the
00:05:09 pretty much the vocal surgery kind of
00:05:10 did it for me um
00:05:12 because i just learned so much about the
00:05:14 effects which again you're just not
00:05:15 taught
00:05:16 um it's not really the drinking it's
00:05:18 staying up all night you know once you
00:05:19 have your drink you end up smoking
00:05:21 and i kind of i i have um
00:05:25 i've become the face of a lot of things
00:05:27 kind of against my
00:05:28 will i guess from my opinions when
00:05:30 you're
00:05:31 someone in my position your opinion
00:05:33 becomes your identity and it also
00:05:35 becomes
00:05:36 kind of almost like um you kind of
00:05:39 become this like preacher you become
00:05:40 this
00:05:41 you know they don't really let you just
00:05:42 always have your own opinion so i've
00:05:43 decided to start telling people
00:05:45 i live my own lifestyle alcohol was
00:05:47 never my problem
00:05:48 there was other things that i end up you
00:05:50 know i like to go up
00:05:53 so i i now just avoid really drinking
00:05:56 because i i like to wake up at 110
00:05:59 um but it's never really been my problem
00:06:01 and i could see myself having a drink of
00:06:02 celebration in the future but
00:06:04 i get so fucking hungover now that i'm
00:06:06 like why would i celebrate with like
00:06:08 just feeling like
00:06:09 a volcano's erupted in my brain you know
00:06:11 so so it's really just a personal
00:06:13 preference but it's definitely not
00:06:15 anything that i promote in i think it's
00:06:17 a lifestyle everyone should be
00:06:18 i think everyone should experiment it's
00:06:20 a good time and you learn a lot of
00:06:22 things about yourself and
00:06:23 the people around you but now i'm
00:06:25 watching i have younger siblings and
00:06:27 they're going through that and i don't
00:06:28 know how my mom did it with me because
00:06:29 it's scary
00:06:30 yeah i don't think i think if we're
00:06:33 going to acknowledge the fact that all
00:06:35 these things exist
00:06:36 cocaine exists pills exist marijuana
00:06:38 exists we should teach people how to do
00:06:40 it right
00:06:40 yeah really i mean you're leaving
00:06:42 children it's the same thing with sex
00:06:44 right
00:06:44 yeah we leave children to their there's
00:06:48 the information that they're going to
00:06:49 get is from other kids yeah and if
00:06:51 you're learning about sex from another
00:06:52 14 year old or you're learning about
00:06:54 coke from a 14 year old
00:06:56 that's not good yeah like someone we
00:06:59 we play this game with children where we
00:07:01 try to pretend
00:07:03 that you know they live in a movie all
00:07:05 right well listen to this it's actually
00:07:06 funny you bring this up because i had
00:07:07 the idea this week not that i really
00:07:09 have time to do this in the near future
00:07:10 but i would like to at some point in my
00:07:11 life
00:07:13 i want to do my own children's
00:07:16 book series of realistic children
00:07:19 stories
00:07:20 because i don't like the idea that we
00:07:22 teach them that this is sunshine world
00:07:24 and everyone walks on a rainbow and
00:07:26 everyone's equal and you need to say
00:07:27 like that's not what are you going to do
00:07:29 about it that's not true what are you
00:07:30 going to do about it
00:07:31 and i think there's a way to not terrify
00:07:33 children of life even though
00:07:34 i go in and out of periods where i think
00:07:36 life is really overwhelmingly terrifying
00:07:38 um and that's coming from my position
00:07:40 and my position
00:07:41 i tell myself all the time if you're not
00:07:43 enjoying this life honey you got it
00:07:45 coming in the next one because i better
00:07:46 fucking love this life it's the best one
00:07:48 i i couldn't imagine being in a
00:07:50 different body and having a different
00:07:51 experience it's an awesome life if you
00:07:52 do it the right way
00:07:53 it's an awesome life and i also i didn't
00:07:56 hurt myself beyond
00:07:58 repair in my experiences i
00:08:01 survived and i don't even mean heart
00:08:04 still beating survival i mean
00:08:06 i have a lot of people that love me
00:08:08 around i didn't kick all the people that
00:08:10 had my best interest at heart out
00:08:12 that's the that's where you die if you
00:08:15 kick everyone that says hey
00:08:17 are you are you okay you know out no of
00:08:19 course i'm okay you don't trust get the
00:08:21 fuck out
00:08:22 and so now that i have people that i've
00:08:24 had in my life i feel that i have people
00:08:26 in my life that i've known for
00:08:28 15 20 years and not many people in my
00:08:31 position get to say that
00:08:32 my parents are awesome my dad's loopy as
00:08:35 hell but i
00:08:36 love him so much um he he has no way
00:08:40 of ever hearing this because my dad
00:08:41 doesn't have wi-fi or uh
00:08:43 anything but a blackberry so i can tell
00:08:44 you what i got for his birthday my dad
00:08:46 has
00:08:46 two blackberries with eagle and a phone
00:08:48 which is not true but that's what he
00:08:50 says so for his birthday he said that he
00:08:51 wanted to see if
00:08:52 he could go 365 days without eating
00:08:54 pizza because he had never done it
00:08:56 before so my dad
00:08:57 has now gone a year without having pizza
00:08:59 and my dad loves bubble bath he's gonna
00:09:01 kill me for saying this but his country
00:09:03 ass loves bubble bath that's hilarious
00:09:05 and so he loves to smoke his joint eat
00:09:07 his pizza and get a bubble bath so he
00:09:08 said that's what i'm gonna do for my
00:09:09 birthday so
00:09:10 for his birthday i've organized a
00:09:12 five-foot pizza to be delivered to his
00:09:14 farm so he can have all he can eat
00:09:16 and i'm the pizza delivery person on the
00:09:19 box i had someone draw it where it's me
00:09:20 with my tongue out and a mullet
00:09:21 delivering the pizza
00:09:22 and i got a bathtub on craigslist and i
00:09:25 put it my dad has 500 acres so i put it
00:09:27 in the middle of the farm
00:09:28 filled with bubble gum just like my
00:09:30 music video and so my dad's going to
00:09:32 have a bubble gum bathtub and a
00:09:33 five-foot pizza for his birthday that's
00:09:35 a door that's next week
00:09:36 that i like the fact that he has no
00:09:38 wi-fi and no internet no wi-fi no
00:09:39 internet every now and then
00:09:41 he's good that way he'll drive to my
00:09:42 uncle's house to facetime us every now
00:09:44 and then oh wow
00:09:45 yeah wow he has to make a drive to
00:09:46 facebook it's not far all of us are just
00:09:48 like
00:09:49 my dad's kept us a a pebbles throw away
00:09:52 for sure
00:09:53 we all live on property we all live
00:09:54 really close to each other so if you did
00:09:56 this thing
00:09:57 like if you really decided to do uh
00:09:59 children's books like realistic
00:10:00 children's
00:10:01 books like how would you do that would
00:10:02 you get a ghost author and sort of come
00:10:04 up with the ideas of what you were
00:10:05 trying to
00:10:06 get across to kids well what do you wish
00:10:08 somebody told you
00:10:10 i like that you mentioned that no one
00:10:13 talks to us about drugs i know this is
00:10:14 going to be controversial to introduce
00:10:16 drugs to kids i think that there's a way
00:10:18 and i have to think about it um wayne
00:10:20 coyne is a good friend of mine and i did
00:10:22 the dead pets record with him flaming
00:10:24 lips have been my favorite band since i
00:10:25 was in fifth grade and he's obviously an
00:10:27 amazing
00:10:27 artist and he just had his first child
00:10:30 year and a half years old he's six he
00:10:31 just had a baby they're coming to visit
00:10:32 me right now
00:10:34 and um i would have him do all the
00:10:36 illustrations so it stays in that kind
00:10:37 of surrealist world because i think
00:10:39 i think that's what would get the kids
00:10:41 to want to read this book is that
00:10:43 that the illustrations are still surreal
00:10:45 um and i like that about children's
00:10:47 books but i do think that
00:10:48 we do need to talk about you know
00:10:51 equality and i do think there needs to
00:10:52 be diversity in children's books and i
00:10:54 think also we just need to talk about
00:10:55 the fact
00:10:56 i was actually happy to talk to you
00:10:58 today because i didn't get to do therapy
00:10:59 today because i would
00:11:00 be with you but it's kind of the same
00:11:01 thing and i was talking to him and i
00:11:03 said you know sometimes it scares me
00:11:05 that i'm too tough and
00:11:06 and i feel like i'm not jaded and i'm
00:11:08 not cold but i feel too tough and he
00:11:10 goes well i'm proud of that because life
00:11:12 is tough
00:11:13 and it's not to get hard what do you
00:11:14 mean by that what do you mean by you
00:11:16 feel like
00:11:16 i don't like that you're too tough i
00:11:19 feel that
00:11:20 i worry sometimes that
00:11:24 i can get over things easily i don't
00:11:27 fall to the floor and crawl up in a ball
00:11:29 the way that i used to and i think
00:11:30 that's a part of me growing up like when
00:11:32 you know i recently just went through
00:11:34 a very public divorce that fucking
00:11:36 sucked what really sucked about it
00:11:38 wasn't the fact that me and someone that
00:11:40 i loved realized that we don't love each
00:11:42 other the way that we used to anymore
00:11:43 that's okay i can accept that i can't
00:11:46 accept
00:11:47 the villainizing and the um
00:11:50 just all those stories that like it's
00:11:52 just amazing to me that the public kind
00:11:54 of thinks that
00:11:56 there's no gap of time that they didn't
00:11:59 see that could possibly be what led to
00:12:01 this like it's not
00:12:03 one day you were happy on the carpet the
00:12:04 next day you were making out with your
00:12:06 friend in italy what the fuck
00:12:07 well there was a lot of time in between
00:12:09 that that you didn't see it didn't go
00:12:12 i didn't like i didn't you know yeah but
00:12:14 you can't rely on someone else's
00:12:16 narrative right
00:12:17 especially someone who doesn't know you
00:12:18 you really shouldn't even read what
00:12:20 people write about
00:12:21 what's crazy is my dad again you know my
00:12:23 dad's been a real figure in my life and
00:12:25 um
00:12:25 my dad when he got his grammy nomination
00:12:27 he wore he went to the grammys in a john
00:12:29 3 16 shirt and he didn't get the grammy
00:12:32 and the next day the new york post if
00:12:34 someone put even god can't save billy
00:12:36 ray cyrus in his career
00:12:38 and he was sitting next to johnny cash
00:12:41 they were
00:12:42 going to something i have a johnny cash
00:12:44 tattoo that was handwritten
00:12:45 uh to my dad from around that time and
00:12:47 he said what the hell just like you say
00:12:49 to me right now
00:12:50 you're my johnny cash you know he said
00:12:52 what the hell are you doing reading that
00:12:54 yeah and my dad said i just never really
00:12:56 picked up the paper again but
00:12:57 again my dad didn't buy that paper it
00:12:59 was just kind of in your face
00:13:01 should have thought that was funny he he
00:13:03 does now now he just says well whatever
00:13:05 will get johnny cash to come and sit
00:13:07 next to me and talk to me now he now he
00:13:09 loves it
00:13:10 um and it's been really good to have him
00:13:12 go before me
00:13:14 you know it's it's kind of that buddy
00:13:16 system i think it'd be really scary if i
00:13:17 would have been able to see that but to
00:13:19 your point of
00:13:20 i don't click on this shit you know it
00:13:22 it comes into my life by
00:13:24 if i walk by a magazine stand which i
00:13:27 like to walk on the street and it says
00:13:29 like
00:13:30 miley's on drugs and pregnant and then i
00:13:32 think
00:13:33 one of those things are true but not the
00:13:35 other fuck you for lying about me
00:13:38 yeah but that's all they have i mean
00:13:40 what when someone's in the public eye
00:13:42 and someone's as prominent as you are
00:13:44 you become a
00:13:45 way for them to access money right
00:13:48 that's all you are clickbait
00:13:49 advertisement and i totally get it it's
00:13:51 that unprogramming of
00:13:54 also i think what's interesting sitting
00:13:57 here
00:13:58 with you is that all of this is kind of
00:14:00 new um
00:14:02 i mean even just like the idea of
00:14:03 podcasts what i used to do when it was
00:14:05 like promo time for a record okay so
00:14:08 i'm 12 years old and i'm printing
00:14:10 physical copies of my
00:14:11 album so i have to write my fucking
00:14:14 music
00:14:14 you know six months before you actually
00:14:17 so i just did dolly's new album for
00:14:19 christmas and i had to record a
00:14:20 christmas song in july it was the
00:14:21 weirdest thing i've ever done in my life
00:14:22 but when you make physical copies that's
00:14:24 what you do
00:14:25 and you're telling a story from always
00:14:27 being
00:14:28 behind especially when it comes to the
00:14:30 media so
00:14:31 now what i love about this what i love
00:14:33 doing you know a show like yours is like
00:14:35 we talk about it right now and people
00:14:37 hear right now so you're getting the
00:14:38 real information
00:14:39 you're not getting information from all
00:14:41 right you know i shot a magazine cover
00:14:44 i did an interview i was la la in love
00:14:46 with my boyfriend i mean that literally
00:14:47 happened when i did vanity fair
00:14:49 i flew there like a week after i got
00:14:51 married by the time the damn thing was
00:14:52 on the stands i was divorced it was old
00:14:53 news
00:14:54 it was like come on you know so you're
00:14:56 really not able to
00:14:58 tell your story in real time and that's
00:14:59 what i love about the new way that music
00:15:01 is happening and streaming and i love
00:15:03 the idea that like
00:15:04 i threw up that um flaming lips record i
00:15:07 did on soundcloud and it was like you
00:15:08 know no one had to buy it or
00:15:10 i sound 105 but it's very exciting
00:15:12 because i really hated always being
00:15:14 behind myself
00:15:15 and i think that's what now i can use my
00:15:19 art
00:15:20 as my kind of i guess the way that i can
00:15:24 talk
00:15:24 to the the press isn't what bothers me
00:15:26 it's kind of the public
00:15:27 you know and and i got in this habit
00:15:29 where when people would meet me and
00:15:31 because i didn't get to have it just
00:15:32 became
00:15:33 a thing that happened constantly was i
00:15:35 meet someone and they go
00:15:37 man you're not as crazy as i thought
00:15:39 you'd be and i'm like
00:15:40 thank you uh i don't know what you
00:15:42 thought i'd be doing right now if you
00:15:44 thought i'd be in like you know space
00:15:46 buns dropping acid or something but
00:15:48 people say that to me all the time that
00:15:49 i'm not as crazy as they thought i would
00:15:51 be and that's just a weird thing to say
00:15:52 to someone
00:15:54 yeah but the public image like what they
00:15:56 sold of you you know here you are
00:15:58 hannah montana and then all sudden
00:16:00 you're this very sexual singer
00:16:02 and you're doing all this crazy stuff
00:16:03 and you're on television shaking your
00:16:05 ass and everybody's seeing that and like
00:16:07 oh miley cyrus is out of control now
00:16:09 she's one
00:16:10 so then that becomes the narrative it's
00:16:11 funny when people make the narrative
00:16:13 when you become in control that now
00:16:15 you're out of it yeah that's
00:16:16 what's always really interesting well
00:16:18 it's also youth right like like think
00:16:20 about the marriage thing right you say
00:16:22 vanity fair they write the article
00:16:23 you're deeply in love by the time it
00:16:25 comes out you're already divorced
00:16:26 right that's so hollywood yeah i mean to
00:16:28 them that's like oh we've seen this
00:16:30 fucking story before yeah we know where
00:16:31 this going uh also
00:16:32 you're a child star oh shit we've seen
00:16:35 this story before
00:16:36 and so you get stuck in that narrative
00:16:39 too right because absolutely
00:16:40 they want you to fall down the exact
00:16:42 same path they don't want you to
00:16:44 fail your past yes well then they'll
00:16:46 spell it out for you this is what she's
00:16:48 doing
00:16:49 she's on drugs and she's pregnant i've
00:16:50 had to con i've had to
00:16:52 now i don't read those types of things
00:16:54 but i've had to
00:16:57 unlearn that they're not true because
00:16:58 sometimes i write things i write things
00:17:00 down
00:17:01 when i want something to get put into my
00:17:03 head even if i'm gonna have a hard
00:17:04 conversation with somebody
00:17:06 usually i kind of write a little mini
00:17:07 script for myself so i kind of know
00:17:09 where i
00:17:09 i don't like going into something with
00:17:11 no direction where do i want this to go
00:17:12 what are my goals what do i want that's
00:17:14 what any of your athletes would do it's
00:17:15 like
00:17:16 i i know that i have that as an artist
00:17:19 i want to have a long career i have to
00:17:21 do the things to
00:17:22 be able to have that um longevity and so
00:17:25 i would write down
00:17:26 you know kind of a kind of an idea of
00:17:28 where i'd want conversations to go
00:17:30 even with the people in my life and what
00:17:32 do i want out of them and i had to stop
00:17:35 going hey just because they wrote that
00:17:37 down it's true because something about
00:17:39 writing it down gives a lot of power
00:17:41 i don't like to write down things that i
00:17:43 don't mean that's why i don't write
00:17:44 songs that i hate
00:17:46 because once you write it down they are
00:17:48 like alive
00:17:49 so what you're saying is that like
00:17:50 reading things that other people wrote
00:17:52 about you made you think that those
00:17:53 things were real so yeah
00:17:55 it fucked with your own personal
00:17:56 narrative yes sometimes i'd be trying to
00:17:59 prove something that i didn't need to
00:18:00 prove
00:18:01 like all of a sudden i'd be trying to
00:18:03 prove that i'm not crazy when i knew i
00:18:05 wasn't crazy
00:18:07 um and yeah i just think also i mean
00:18:11 when we're talking about realistic
00:18:12 children's books i think the stigma that
00:18:15 kind of uh
00:18:16 surrounds you know youth growing up
00:18:18 rebelling and then craziness and then
00:18:21 what's the line between that and mental
00:18:23 illness and you know
00:18:24 i do have some kind of genetic family
00:18:27 history of
00:18:28 alcohol i mean that totally gets a race
00:18:29 when you're a celebrity it's like
00:18:31 hollywood did this to you it's like no
00:18:32 dude my great-grandma was an alcoholic
00:18:34 you know my granddad was an alcoholic
00:18:36 my grandma's an alcoholic you know so i
00:18:40 i obviously had it wasn't hollywood you
00:18:42 know it's
00:18:43 genetic i think for you i mean i don't
00:18:46 think there's anything wrong with
00:18:47 writing a book
00:18:48 and writing a realistic children's book
00:18:50 but i think you could do a lot of good
00:18:52 by just making little youtube videos
00:18:54 because you make little youtube videos
00:18:56 just talking
00:18:57 and explaining hey this is what i did
00:18:59 and this is where i fucked up and this
00:19:01 is why you shouldn't do it this way
00:19:03 these are the drugs you got to be really
00:19:04 careful about these are drugs that are
00:19:06 really dangerous
00:19:07 and look if you want to have like one
00:19:09 drink you want to have
00:19:10 one drink like just have one fucking
00:19:12 drink if you can if you can
00:19:14 yeah if you want to if you want to smoke
00:19:16 weed take a hit
00:19:17 yeah like don't get crazy yeah like
00:19:19 figure this out like you can
00:19:21 have a good experience on marijuana or
00:19:23 you could fuck up your life and have a
00:19:25 schizophrenic breakdown that's one thing
00:19:27 that i feel like you know when i was
00:19:29 smoking weed
00:19:29 like my mom all the weed that i don't
00:19:31 smoke she
00:19:32 takes care of both my parents so i have
00:19:34 nothing against weed
00:19:36 my whole family is a bunch of stoners i
00:19:38 i just felt like when you're talking
00:19:39 about kind of some of the
00:19:40 the episodes that they can kind of bring
00:19:43 on you know i maybe have
00:19:45 a little some of those kind of
00:19:46 tendencies already
00:19:48 um and that's that's something that
00:19:50 people who love marijuana
00:19:52 don't like to talk about and i'm pretty
00:19:53 adamant about discussing that
00:19:55 yeah i i know people that have lost
00:19:57 their fucking mind
00:19:58 particularly on edibles yeah i i know
00:20:00 some people that literally became
00:20:02 schizophrenic
00:20:03 and i really like looking at
00:20:06 i like looking at facts like that and i
00:20:08 don't know you know i do think that
00:20:10 there are
00:20:10 i like i like information i'm a real
00:20:14 i love to process new information um
00:20:17 i love to receive new information i love
00:20:20 to go
00:20:21 how do you get your information are you
00:20:22 a person who reads do you watch
00:20:23 documentaries
00:20:24 i read and i uh kind of
00:20:28 i was going on a i was going on a trip
00:20:30 when i was maybe 17 years old and i was
00:20:32 walking through the airport and i saw
00:20:34 a book that said change your brain
00:20:35 change your life by dr daniel amen who's
00:20:37 now
00:20:38 been my therapist for 10 years and i
00:20:41 couldn't get on this plane i was having
00:20:42 a full
00:20:43 anxiety attack with smoking a lot of
00:20:44 weeds i was taking a lot of shrimps i
00:20:46 was 17.
00:20:46 17 smoking a lot of weed and taking away
00:20:48 mushrooms and i started getting a little
00:20:50 yeah i started getting a little
00:20:52 cray-cray you know sometimes i recommend
00:20:53 that
00:20:54 doing some things with you know causing
00:20:56 some fights with my boyfriend that were
00:20:58 unnecessary
00:20:59 they got heightened um i remember one
00:21:01 time i wrecked my car into my gate and i
00:21:03 said this is all your fault i was the
00:21:05 one driving the damn car and how is this
00:21:06 your fault
00:21:07 i did not have a great idea of reality
00:21:09 at that time
00:21:11 so i was going to i was leaving the
00:21:13 country for the first time without my
00:21:14 family i was going to costa rica and i
00:21:16 was walking through the airport i saw
00:21:17 this book change your brain change your
00:21:18 life i'm like i
00:21:19 i want to change my life i don't like
00:21:20 where this is going and my brain is
00:21:22 actually i don't like who i'm living
00:21:23 with the person upstairs is like
00:21:25 annoying the hell out of me so i got
00:21:28 this book and it got me to get onto the
00:21:30 plane now i had a few
00:21:31 anxious breakdowns on that when you know
00:21:34 when you go to places like
00:21:35 going in the middle of jungle you take
00:21:36 all those little planes and all of a
00:21:37 sudden you're on a four-wheeler going
00:21:38 wherever you're going
00:21:39 every now and then i'd have to stop
00:21:40 because i would get so light-headed
00:21:42 stabbing chest pains and all this and he
00:21:44 said
00:21:46 drop weed first of all get rid of the
00:21:47 weed get rid of the psychedelics and i
00:21:49 also cut gluten from my diet from a
00:21:51 little bit of a time so i could get an
00:21:52 idea of like
00:21:53 what's my body on a natural level and i
00:21:56 started doing you know
00:21:57 kind of blood work and i i did some spec
00:21:59 scans which he specializes in so like
00:22:01 actually looking at my brain because
00:22:02 what i really like about the spec scan
00:22:04 is
00:22:04 you know you wouldn't tell me i have a
00:22:06 broken arm without freaking looking at
00:22:07 it i could tell you out it hurts blah
00:22:09 blah blah but like
00:22:09 what is the spec scan so a spec scan um
00:22:12 we might have to look up exactly what it
00:22:14 stands for
00:22:15 because i don't i don't remember this
00:22:16 but basically it's kind of like
00:22:18 an x-ray and it kind of shows you almost
00:22:20 like in those thermal type colors of the
00:22:22 activity of your brain
00:22:23 there we go single photon emission
00:22:26 computed
00:22:27 tomography yeah so i have one of these
00:22:29 nuclear medicine study that evaluates
00:22:31 blood flow and activity to
00:22:32 in the brain so that's my doctor aim in
00:22:34 clinics that's that's his uh website
00:22:36 right there
00:22:37 and so i have a couple of these um how's
00:22:40 your brain look
00:22:41 you know what so he says this isn't
00:22:43 right surprisingly good for the abuse
00:22:45 that it's had
00:22:46 because i started my throat but exactly
00:22:48 that's the amount of time
00:22:49 it's all okay so the amount of activity
00:22:51 if we're looking at like female and male
00:22:53 brains i mean they're totally lit up in
00:22:55 different spots
00:22:56 you know um actually i think he's even
00:22:58 worked with some some athletes of yours
00:23:00 he works a lot of like with football
00:23:01 players because he says you know like
00:23:02 you know i'm almost like a football
00:23:03 player for the life that i lead
00:23:05 i gotta do everything else right if
00:23:07 you're going to go and live under this
00:23:08 amount of stress which is pretty
00:23:10 abnormal
00:23:10 it's like you're getting hit in the head
00:23:12 an abnormal amount of times then i got
00:23:14 to do everything else right so i got to
00:23:15 be pretty diligent about my supplements
00:23:17 i got to really care about the food that
00:23:19 i my mom always says like you guys are
00:23:21 overthinking it i've eaten cheetos every
00:23:22 single day it's true
00:23:24 for the rest of my life and i'm like
00:23:25 yeah but you're not like a you know
00:23:27 you're not a superstar that has to go on
00:23:29 stage and do two hour shows you know my
00:23:31 heart really needs to be in good
00:23:32 condition i need to be in good condition
00:23:34 i can't by the way my mom has crazy
00:23:35 panic attacks so like
00:23:37 i can't have any of that my mom has had
00:23:39 me slam like had them slam the brakes on
00:23:41 an
00:23:41 airplane to take off and made me drive
00:23:43 home from canada to tennessee
00:23:45 i drove from tennessee to canada nine
00:23:46 times because of her anxiety i've driven
00:23:49 from nashville to california like four
00:23:52 times because of her anxiety so i don't
00:23:54 listen to him
00:23:54 off the cheetos exactly my grandma was
00:23:57 on a popcorn diet where she took a trash
00:23:59 bag to the movie theater
00:24:00 and filled it up with popcorn and she's
00:24:02 like don't i look good i'm like on the
00:24:04 outside
00:24:05 it's fine on the inside i'm worried
00:24:07 meanwhile she's going to outlive all of
00:24:08 us so sometimes i'll worry about that
00:24:10 but
00:24:10 i think i am kind of like an athlete in
00:24:12 the ways like if i'm going to be
00:24:13 doing this kind of absolutely type
00:24:15 lifestyle then
00:24:17 i have to do everything else right so my
00:24:18 spec scan looks pretty good but i like
00:24:20 looking at my brain and knowing
00:24:24 okay so this isn't looking at me and
00:24:26 going there's just something wrong with
00:24:27 me and i don't know why i had a head
00:24:29 injury when i was
00:24:30 you know two years old what happened
00:24:33 it's bad my dad had me this is really
00:24:36 bad but he can't go to jail i don't
00:24:37 think it's long enough
00:24:39 time away he had me in a baby backpack
00:24:41 and i was on a dirt bike with my dad
00:24:43 and he was riding and a tree had fallen
00:24:46 and he ducked and i didn't i hit my head
00:24:48 on the tree
00:24:49 oh jesus christ so that's what's wrong
00:24:51 everyone's asked me that phrase well
00:24:52 that you know that's a common theme with
00:24:54 wild people
00:24:55 do you know that yes sam kinnison got
00:24:57 hit by a car when he was like a little
00:25:00 kid and his brother bill said it
00:25:02 completely changed his life
00:25:03 we have just like a real cop same thing
00:25:05 with roseanne barr
00:25:06 she got hit by a car when she was 15.
00:25:08 before that she was like
00:25:09 mild-mannered really good at math after
00:25:12 she got hit by a car she had to spend
00:25:14 nine months at a mental institution
00:25:15 couldn't count anymore and she became
00:25:17 this wild lady
00:25:18 who who everybody knows as roseanne
00:25:20 right i mean maybe uh maybe i'm thankful
00:25:22 for it maybe it like i don't know
00:25:24 knocked me into this identity or
00:25:25 something i think there's something to
00:25:27 i'm not
00:25:28 sure he knows that there's something to
00:25:29 that dr eamon we've talked about this a
00:25:31 lot so when i get really overwhelmed
00:25:33 i also have a tendency that if i know
00:25:35 something stupid i just gotta try it
00:25:37 to know that it's stupid which is makes
00:25:39 it stupid because i already knew about
00:25:40 it sometimes i'm like is it better to
00:25:41 know it's dumb and do it or to not know
00:25:42 it's dumb and do it don't you think part
00:25:44 of that that's a head injury
00:25:46 well maybe but also it's the final
00:25:49 of your breaks but you know the way you
00:25:51 developed as a human being being that
00:25:53 famous at
00:25:54 you know 12 years old doing stadiums but
00:25:56 i do like i like looking at my brain and
00:25:58 going okay listen like someone cut my
00:26:00 breaks right
00:26:01 on my brain and i have to take all the
00:26:02 things omega i i've been
00:26:04 was vegan for a very long time and i've
00:26:06 had to introduce fish and omegas into my
00:26:09 life because
00:26:10 my brain wasn't functioning properly um
00:26:13 don't tell that to the vegans they'll
00:26:14 come for you that's they're gonna come
00:26:15 for me but that's okay
00:26:17 um i'm used to people coming for me and
00:26:19 it's gonna be that i call my salary
00:26:21 no i listen if i i
00:26:24 give home i have 22 animals on my farm
00:26:26 in nashville i've got 22
00:26:28 and my house in calabasas like i'm doing
00:26:30 what i need to do for the animals
00:26:32 okay okay but when it comes to my brain
00:26:34 you're not vegan
00:26:35 no you can't be vegan and living this
00:26:37 kind and not being this quick but
00:26:39 sure you can some people can i cannot
00:26:41 because it was really giving i was how
00:26:43 did it do for your brain
00:26:44 i feel that i'm slowed you down now i'm
00:26:46 so much sharper than i was and i think
00:26:49 that i was at one point pretty
00:26:51 malnutrition
00:26:52 like i remember going to um glastonbury
00:26:55 and that was a show that i
00:26:56 loved i loved my performance but i was
00:26:59 running on empty
00:27:00 like i was on i was on can i ask you
00:27:04 were you doing
00:27:04 a vegan diet like particularly yesterday
00:27:07 you're doing it but you're doing
00:27:08 intelligently like
00:27:10 myself the right way i do all my protein
00:27:12 drinks i've
00:27:14 watched every bodybuilder's youtube
00:27:16 about how they still
00:27:17 you can't pay attention to train that's
00:27:19 what i'm saying all of a sudden i'm like
00:27:21 those guys celery and like why are my
00:27:23 thighs like fucking huge
00:27:24 like vegan bodybuilder guys they're
00:27:26 almost all on steroids
00:27:28 it's it's it's not on steroids well they
00:27:30 i mean
00:27:31 and they're you know they're different
00:27:32 bodies too some people i have good
00:27:34 friends that are vegan and they they're
00:27:36 fine on it my friend john joseph he's
00:27:37 been the vegan for like 30 years that's
00:27:39 why i think nate diaz i was stoked he
00:27:41 was a vegetarian
00:27:42 vegetarian no he's at one point or a
00:27:44 pescetarian yeah
00:27:48 that's where i'm at there's a lot of
00:27:49 people that function really well with
00:27:51 that but some people find it's
00:27:52 everybody's different you know we all
00:27:54 have different ancestors and our
00:27:55 ancestors come from different parts of
00:27:57 the world and you know i don't know if
00:27:59 the blood type thing is accurate but
00:28:01 some people really
00:28:02 believe that so this is another thing
00:28:03 that i like about seeing the brain is i
00:28:05 try to eat from my brain type and not my
00:28:06 blood type
00:28:07 necessarily my brain type so my brain
00:28:09 type
00:28:10 i really need breaks on my brain because
00:28:12 i did i did not have that where i
00:28:14 in my new song it says i can't bite the
00:28:16 devil on my tongue that was like a
00:28:17 really
00:28:18 hard thing for me to learn how to do but
00:28:20 instead of going i'm just totally
00:28:22 impulsive and the most reactive person
00:28:24 ever
00:28:25 i look and go well but my dad also
00:28:26 slammed my head into a tree when i was
00:28:28 two
00:28:29 so you know it's maybe as a dad that's
00:28:31 hard to hear that scares the shit out
00:28:33 i've given him a
00:28:34 award for worst dad ever every time i go
00:28:37 you know if we're on hollywood and
00:28:39 there's the best dad award i scratch out
00:28:41 best and put worse
00:28:42 um but he was also the best because he
00:28:44 would allow me to do a lot of other
00:28:45 crazy things that were awesome
00:28:46 well it you're fine yeah i'm fine my dad
00:28:49 let me steal
00:28:50 chickens from the malibu barn that
00:28:52 little red barn when you come down to
00:28:54 panga
00:28:55 my dad they were gonna feed these
00:28:56 chickens to the snakes and they let us
00:28:58 back there and my dad was like listen
00:29:00 i'm billy ray cyrus i'm gonna totally
00:29:01 distract him you shove as many chickens
00:29:03 in the back of the corvette as you can
00:29:05 while i'm signing autographs and we're
00:29:06 gonna get the hell out of here
00:29:08 so i did i went me and my brother got
00:29:09 all these damn chickens and we shoved
00:29:11 him in the back of his car
00:29:12 and he was gonna snakes went hungry he
00:29:14 was about to go work for david lynch
00:29:16 well he was gonna audition for him for
00:29:18 mulholland drive and my dad brought the
00:29:19 chickens in the corvette and he said if
00:29:21 you're gonna have chickens in the
00:29:22 corvette like you're playing the pool
00:29:24 guy you know that's a pool guy thing to
00:29:25 do
00:29:26 so my dad got the job so because he got
00:29:28 the job he had to stay in l.a and we had
00:29:29 to go back to tennessee so he told me
00:29:31 and my
00:29:32 mom to tell the people on the airplane
00:29:34 that they were
00:29:35 exotic himalayan cockatoos and we did
00:29:38 and they let them on the plane and we
00:29:40 had them in the purse and we
00:29:41 we they lived in a bathtub and like on
00:29:43 hollywood and highland in some hotel for
00:29:44 a long time
00:29:45 and then we got home and the night we
00:29:48 got there our dogs got in the chicken
00:29:50 coop made them all so they died anyway
00:29:52 but that's the kind of dad my dad is he
00:29:53 sets you up for failure and for
00:29:55 disappointment but i like that about him
00:29:56 because he made me tough
00:29:57 well i mean it's hard to keep dogs out
00:29:59 of chicken coops i had a dog got in the
00:30:00 chicken coop too
00:30:02 i had a lot of chickens at one point in
00:30:03 time and then after the last fire
00:30:06 out here yeah my chicken coop my house
00:30:08 stayed okay but my chicken coop burnt to
00:30:09 the ground
00:30:10 damn and then we had to put him in a
00:30:11 smaller chicken coop and the coyotes got
00:30:13 him that's the thing
00:30:14 that's the thing you can't blame dad for
00:30:16 nature that's the way that it is you
00:30:17 can't
00:30:17 dogs will eat chickens yeah they give
00:30:20 them a chance
00:30:21 several snakes apparently he is fuck
00:30:23 yeah yeah
00:30:24 so you your brain like when they do this
00:30:27 scan
00:30:28 do they do they tell you what you should
00:30:30 do to make it better like what do they
00:30:32 do they look at and go oh you're fucked
00:30:34 up
00:30:36 you know he works kind of with you know
00:30:38 i guess a lot of um
00:30:40 you know kind of mostly athletes people
00:30:42 that kind of live abnormal lifestyle and
00:30:44 and so
00:30:45 injuries yeah he just posted a cool
00:30:46 picture with tyson and he just works
00:30:48 with
00:30:48 all different i love seeing the other
00:30:50 brains that i'm allowed to see also
00:30:52 because it kind of is fun to
00:30:54 i would love like a match.com but like
00:30:56 where people just put their brain scans
00:30:57 and be like i like that one
00:30:58 that's lighting up the right where i
00:31:00 need it you know you got something i
00:31:02 don't have
00:31:02 that would be actually amazing that's
00:31:04 how it worked because
00:31:05 like personalities are weird like people
00:31:08 sometimes you go well
00:31:09 i don't they just work together exactly
00:31:11 and i mean it has to do with that you
00:31:13 know i'm not really looking now
00:31:15 i guess for as much as i'm looking for
00:31:16 the this i want the soul connection but
00:31:19 i'm more about the brain connection i'm
00:31:20 a very logical i like to have kind of
00:31:22 logic in my life because
00:31:25 i used to be kind of owned by emotion in
00:31:27 a way i was very emotional
00:31:29 and that's what i meant by i think we
00:31:30 spun off of what i meant by tough
00:31:32 so i used to be very emotional and um
00:31:35 i used to cry about things and now you
00:31:38 get over things and also more
00:31:39 like i would really kind of just like i
00:31:42 would just become such a recluse i have
00:31:44 that tendency my dad
00:31:45 my dad said he's everyone's just getting
00:31:47 on social distancing he's been doing it
00:31:48 since 1992.
00:31:49 like my dad's been on social i said as
00:31:51 soon as we walked in here you know i
00:31:53 it made me that was around achy breaky
00:31:55 heart time yes
00:31:56 right 92 is that was right when i was
00:31:59 born and that is when it was all
00:32:01 crazy so that also explains i mean i
00:32:03 think somewhat of my
00:32:05 uh just who i am my personality how i
00:32:08 how i did your dad talk to you about
00:32:10 what the anxiety was like for him when
00:32:12 he
00:32:13 became famous well my dad's your dad was
00:32:15 my deck for people don't know
00:32:17 in the nine early 90s your dad was a
00:32:19 fucking superstar
00:32:20 but he had a very different lifestyle
00:32:22 than i did as my dad grew up
00:32:24 in a house that didn't even have an
00:32:25 indoor bathroom my dad hadn't gone to
00:32:27 the dentist until he was 30 years old my
00:32:29 dad had never gone to a dentist my dad
00:32:30 grew up poor
00:32:31 my his my uncle still lives in their
00:32:33 same house he's got an indoor bathroom
00:32:34 now because my dad's
00:32:35 a g and put that in but he still lives
00:32:38 in the same house
00:32:39 and um yeah so my dad grew up in like uh
00:32:42 you probably
00:32:42 have seen it it's one of the poorer
00:32:44 areas in the country my dad grew up in
00:32:46 appalachia and kentucky so it's my mom
00:32:48 so um i've been there
00:32:49 a bunch and i've been able to see where
00:32:51 my dad's from so he had a different
00:32:53 relationship to fame because he went
00:32:55 from nothing to everything
00:32:57 i went kind of from having you know
00:33:01 everything if we look at really the way
00:33:03 i grew up lived in a big house on a big
00:33:05 farm the only thing that was sad about
00:33:07 is we didn't have
00:33:07 kind of neighbors or normal kids around
00:33:10 because i lived on this big kind of
00:33:11 isolated farm but went to school had
00:33:13 this normal life but i mean if we really
00:33:14 look at it
00:33:15 i didn't know when i was a kid that i
00:33:17 had everything but i had everything so i
00:33:19 went from having it all
00:33:20 to having more and that i don't know
00:33:23 what's harder to kind of
00:33:25 uh to kind of humanize i guess about
00:33:28 yourself because
00:33:30 my life is is is very unique and so it's
00:33:32 very hard for me to
00:33:33 to sit with someone and relate to them
00:33:36 and i think that made me really scared
00:33:38 because um my mom doesn't like to be
00:33:40 alone so i have that fear
00:33:42 in my mind if i don't want to be alone
00:33:43 but i think what makes you lonely isn't
00:33:45 the amount of people are around but like
00:33:46 am i relating to people am i really
00:33:48 connecting
00:33:49 well you must have a hard time
00:33:51 connecting to people
00:33:52 because they don't have the same life
00:33:55 experience as you your reality
00:33:57 it's like you're in a you're in a fish
00:33:58 bowl you're in a different reality
00:34:00 and you're hanging out next to people
00:34:02 that aren't in the fishbowl here's the
00:34:03 difference of the fishbowl
00:34:04 so we usually put the fish in the fish
00:34:07 bowl and i
00:34:08 you know i reborn the fish right we do
00:34:10 it and i was born into it but then again
00:34:13 i put myself into it so if you get a
00:34:14 beta you're the one that does it you did
00:34:16 it when you were a little kid and you
00:34:18 didn't know what you were doing but my
00:34:19 parents didn't really want me to so my
00:34:21 parents my dad
00:34:22 wouldn't even really go with us to the
00:34:23 auditions he was actually kind of mad at
00:34:25 my mom about it
00:34:26 that was kind of a thing and then my
00:34:27 mom's like i'm gonna do this so you know
00:34:29 she stays in this small town she's gonna
00:34:30 be like everybody else that just ends up
00:34:32 on drugs
00:34:32 so she took me to l.a mom like hello
00:34:36 she didn't even smoke weed yet well this
00:34:38 is that's not the ab
00:34:40 that i've ever heard of like let's avoid
00:34:42 drugs in nashville so let's get more and
00:34:44 better a lot better drugs
00:34:45 in l.a but what what's we're going way
00:34:48 off track
00:34:49 what what bothers you about being more
00:34:52 resilient
00:34:53 because that's what it sounds like it
00:34:54 doesn't when you say more tough
00:34:56 you're talking about the difference
00:34:57 between someone who reacts
00:34:59 overly emotionally to something you
00:35:01 would follow the ground and curl up in a
00:35:02 ball and cry about things
00:35:03 and now you can get over them that to me
00:35:06 is a
00:35:06 sign of perspective okay so here's where
00:35:08 it is and i don't even want to have
00:35:10 a conversation about like really you
00:35:12 know sexism or men versus women because
00:35:14 like i love dudes you know and i i
00:35:16 actually relate to dudes a lot more
00:35:18 um but i think men in my life have told
00:35:20 me that i'm cold i'm a cold fucking
00:35:21 bitch because i leave when things are
00:35:23 done
00:35:24 i was actually gonna say well maybe
00:35:25 you've been dating bitches i'm really
00:35:27 into a lot of freaky things but i don't
00:35:29 fuck dead guys and when it's over it's
00:35:30 over and you're dead to me and we move
00:35:32 on
00:35:32 you know so that's how i feel about it
00:35:34 that's heavy and i'll do a lot of things
00:35:36 but i don't do that
00:35:37 and so i um think that that's where
00:35:40 i've gotten the idea which actually i'm
00:35:42 glad you just said that to me because i
00:35:43 i get this kind of
00:35:45 beating into the brain from all
00:35:47 different angles my mom's like you know
00:35:48 everyone else is proud of me for being
00:35:50 like you said resilient and i have a lot
00:35:52 of guilt i'm a very guilty person that
00:35:54 sounds like you're talking to guys who
00:35:56 want you to feel guilty
00:35:58 because you don't feel emotional about
00:35:59 it ending and this is the first time
00:36:01 you learn how to just let shit go if
00:36:03 they like you or if they love you they
00:36:05 love you
00:36:05 they have to well that's a hard thing
00:36:08 they should want you to be happy
00:36:10 just let it pass and then be friends
00:36:12 okay so
00:36:13 if they can't do that that's on them
00:36:15 that's not on you because you're very
00:36:17 older man because these like guys that
00:36:19 are you know i definitely should be with
00:36:21 someone i think that i got to find nick
00:36:22 nolte this is what i'm thinking
00:36:24 this is what i'm this is what i'm
00:36:26 thinking i don't need a man or
00:36:28 a woman that's gonna take care of me i
00:36:31 can take care of me because i've got
00:36:32 money i've got all the things that i
00:36:33 need to take care of myself i need them
00:36:35 to be able to take care of them
00:36:37 because somehow i keep getting into when
00:36:39 you need someone with autonomy
00:36:41 yes that's what you need you need
00:36:42 someone who they don't
00:36:44 need your constant approval and
00:36:47 affection and now that we're using this
00:36:48 word
00:36:49 need just for the record i guess i
00:36:51 really don't need to be in a
00:36:52 relationship at all so that's good we
00:36:54 got to this point see this is therapy
00:36:55 yeah you don't need it but it does sound
00:36:58 nice
00:36:58 people can poison you with their ideas
00:37:00 of what you should be
00:37:02 and if you don't meet up to their
00:37:03 expectations and oftentimes their
00:37:05 expectations of you are just to reaffirm
00:37:08 themselves
00:37:09 they want you to love them they want you
00:37:12 to tell them how awesome they are and if
00:37:14 you don't feel that way
00:37:15 you're cold yeah there's something wrong
00:37:17 with you because they don't have
00:37:18 autonomy they can't exist independently
00:37:20 right that's the problem right the
00:37:22 problem there's a lot of bitches out
00:37:23 there
00:37:23 i like it you said it not me that's how
00:37:25 i feel and honestly
00:37:26 we're talking at a very uh this is a
00:37:29 super like
00:37:30 kind of pivotal moment for me right now
00:37:32 i haven't been single and like
00:37:34 i guess really from 2015 i mean there's
00:37:37 been little months so maybe about five
00:37:39 years like i've had you know a few
00:37:40 months here and there where i've been
00:37:41 single but not for a long period of time
00:37:43 and
00:37:44 you know something i'm really excited
00:37:45 about is uh this vma performance that's
00:37:48 coming up
00:37:48 and i love that it's the first time that
00:37:51 i'm gonna be on that stage as
00:37:52 a single badass grown evolved secure
00:37:56 um woman that's done a lot of work like
00:37:59 i've done i've done the work
00:38:00 and that's the thing is some people say
00:38:03 um you know
00:38:04 like how did you how did you get here
00:38:05 you know you turned out pretty good it's
00:38:06 like
00:38:07 dude i've i worked really hard at it but
00:38:10 just
00:38:10 seriously get it in your head any time
00:38:12 someone
00:38:13 gives you a hard time about being strong
00:38:16 you're not a bad person just because
00:38:19 you're strong
00:38:20 just because you don't cry as easy as
00:38:22 you used to that's ridiculous
00:38:24 yeah it's ridiculous it's perspective
00:38:26 that's all it is you're not a bad
00:38:28 all these fucking animals you have yeah
00:38:30 how could you be a bad person if you
00:38:31 love animals dude i put this stuff
00:38:32 called monkey butt on my dogs what is
00:38:34 monkey
00:38:34 every day this baby powder for dog butts
00:38:37 because i
00:38:38 i got uh this guy one of my friends my
00:38:41 friend who said oh my god this is a
00:38:42 whole other story my friend who's
00:38:43 sitting out there right now tried to
00:38:45 immediately you know make me happy
00:38:46 because i just went through a breakup
00:38:47 and showed me a hot guy on instagram
00:38:49 and i started scrolling i see him
00:38:50 putting this powder on his dog's ass i'm
00:38:52 like i don't want him but i want that
00:38:53 stuff for the dog's ass that looks great
00:38:55 so i ordered it right away monkey butt
00:38:57 so i have a dog her
00:38:58 uh she can't see she can't hear she can
00:39:00 barely walk
00:39:01 she was dropped at a fire station she
00:39:02 was over bred she's a bulldog you know
00:39:04 and they
00:39:04 breed them crazy and she uh can barely
00:39:07 get off the floor
00:39:08 she's so overweight and her name is kate
00:39:10 moss and what i love about it
00:39:12 is i tell everybody when i'm coming to
00:39:14 set you know
00:39:16 i'm gonna bring kate moss make sure
00:39:17 she's good she's covered tested we're
00:39:19 all good
00:39:20 and then all the men on set's face are
00:39:22 the best because it's like i thought
00:39:23 miley cyrus is bringing kate moss is
00:39:25 gonna be the best day of my life
00:39:26 and then she comes in with her big ass
00:39:29 literally that i have
00:39:30 baby powder she has diapers because i i
00:39:32 put diapers on her for when she comes to
00:39:34 set because her butt is like atrocious
00:39:36 do you just need to get her on a diet
00:39:37 i have her on her diet honestly i'll
00:39:39 show you some pictures when we're done
00:39:40 with this because
00:39:41 she had this thing called a cherry eye
00:39:42 and everyone she didn't have both eyes
00:39:44 so they were trying to get me to like
00:39:45 either remove her eye or do all the
00:39:47 searching whatever i'm like let me do
00:39:48 this the old-fashioned way
00:39:49 so every day i get up i clean her eyes
00:39:51 see i'm not a bad person i
00:39:53 clean her eyes i put four drops in two
00:39:55 times a day give her three tablets
00:39:57 she's lost probably ten pounds already
00:39:59 and the cherries are completely out of
00:40:00 her eyes she is
00:40:01 healed and what i love about her and
00:40:03 i'll show you these videos
00:40:04 is uh she does she can sing that's what
00:40:08 really locked her in so
00:40:08 i've never known this to be a for a dog
00:40:10 to do this when i do scales
00:40:12 and i warm up from my shows she howls
00:40:15 and sings with me and she's got perfect
00:40:16 pitch that's cool so i haven't even
00:40:18 adopted her yet i was fostering her and
00:40:20 i was gonna take her to set hoping you
00:40:21 know
00:40:22 somebody's kids wanted a dog and they
00:40:24 would want her and the first thing that
00:40:26 someone said is a face only a mother can
00:40:27 love and i was like that's not true i
00:40:28 love her
00:40:29 um and so i love her because she started
00:40:31 singing to me and then i i adopted her
00:40:33 right then she's so
00:40:34 ugly that they waved the adoption fee
00:40:36 they said
00:40:37 that's not a lie they literally she was
00:40:39 free and i i now have to remind myself
00:40:41 they say the best things in life are
00:40:42 free and when i look at her and her big
00:40:44 ass
00:40:44 i know it's true so ugly she's free i
00:40:46 had a friend who had wolves he had wolf
00:40:48 dogs and you could you could
00:40:50 like sing in his house and the wolves
00:40:52 would start howling you go yes
00:40:56 see my my dogs do that with the
00:40:57 ambulance here oh yeah coyotes do that
00:40:59 yes
00:41:00 so they start going then my dogs start
00:41:02 going so all the dogs sing but they
00:41:03 none of them do it to scale like kate
00:41:05 moss
00:41:06 [Laughter]
00:41:07 that's adorable oh yeah she's good so
00:41:10 yeah don't let anybody tell you that
00:41:11 there's
00:41:12 something wrong with being resilient
00:41:14 yeah but people
00:41:15 will do that men will do that i see a
00:41:16 lot of men do that with women
00:41:18 they want women to feel bad they want
00:41:20 them to feel bad for for not being
00:41:21 emotional and i used to get small that's
00:41:23 what i'm telling you see that's what i
00:41:25 it used to be really easy to kind of put
00:41:27 me back in the you know kind of
00:41:28 jack-in-the-box
00:41:29 kind of thing you know you can get me to
00:41:31 come out and just for a little while but
00:41:32 it's it's it's become suspiciously
00:41:36 convenient timing it always seems that i
00:41:39 get told
00:41:40 that i'm a cold bitch before right when
00:41:42 you're done right when i'm right when
00:41:44 i'm ready to put out fucking music
00:41:45 it happens every day because you're
00:41:47 focused on other things
00:41:49 exactly and then it's like you know and
00:41:52 then i
00:41:53 it's just it's all it's a whole thing
00:41:55 you have so much energy like the way you
00:41:57 talk and all the sentences run on into
00:41:59 the next
00:42:00 do you exercise yes i exercise what do
00:42:02 you do i love pilates
00:42:04 and uh it's not super i guess cardio
00:42:07 i think you need to do something i need
00:42:08 to run a little bit more i need to do
00:42:10 something
00:42:10 i got a bag being put in my house right
00:42:12 now so i'm gonna next time i'm here i'll
00:42:14 show you i'll be here protect your hands
00:42:17 these nails come off i just have them
00:42:18 taped on this is dolly style
00:42:20 everything about me is taped on honey uh
00:42:23 it's an easy at night you just go watch
00:42:25 it
00:42:25 and i like uh yeah it's all just tape
00:42:28 people that have
00:42:29 played guitar and and musical
00:42:31 instruments and they hurt their hands
00:42:32 i actually had a uh i had a guy told me
00:42:35 that i had grubby little kid hands
00:42:37 and i liked that about it because i did
00:42:39 have dirt and that was because this was
00:42:41 at a time where i was doing drugs and i
00:42:42 wanted to know where the hell did
00:42:43 gophers go
00:42:44 so there was a gopher hole in my
00:42:46 backyard and i'm like where do they keep
00:42:48 going
00:42:49 i see them pop up and they go away and
00:42:51 i'm like so you're if you can dig to
00:42:52 china you can dig a fucking find a
00:42:54 gopher so here i go
00:42:55 you can't really dig to china i know
00:42:57 that much and you can't find the gophers
00:42:58 either you can
00:42:59 yeah my gardener knows how to get them i
00:43:01 could not find the gophers and i
00:43:03 looked for a very long time i even tried
00:43:05 to get them out with pizza
00:43:07 i brought pizza down into the hole
00:43:08 hoping that you know everybody loves
00:43:10 pizza
00:43:10 apparently not gophers you rarely see
00:43:12 gophers but you see their holes
00:43:14 that's what i'm telling you that's where
00:43:15 i was trying to go
00:43:17 that's it you know when someone tells
00:43:19 you that they've been enlightened they
00:43:20 saw jesus and you know
00:43:21 whatever i wanted to see i don't even
00:43:23 want to see jesus i just want to see a
00:43:24 damn gopher
00:43:26 so i went into the hole and i never saw
00:43:28 gopher
00:43:29 i see a wolverine i'll die disappointed
00:43:31 if i was one animal i could see in
00:43:33 in the wild i'd like to see a wolverine
00:43:34 see you're like
00:43:36 that's that's next level i just wanted
00:43:38 freaking regular dagular gopher in the
00:43:40 backyard
00:43:42 you rarely see them but i've seen them
00:43:44 but i i think both rains are dope
00:43:47 well i just think seeing one of them
00:43:49 fuckers and that's rare it's rare to see
00:43:51 one of those things in the world
00:43:52 my dad uh my dad wanted to see a bear
00:43:56 for 30 years he had this dream this is
00:43:58 so i have some i don't know if he's
00:43:59 lying or if he's what the hell is going
00:44:01 on but we're on this plane and he's
00:44:02 so excited he's like i'm going to see he
00:44:04 my dad's a little kind of intuitive that
00:44:05 way and he's like i'm going to finally
00:44:07 do it i've been looking for 30 years
00:44:09 and when you look hard enough and and
00:44:10 you're diligent about what you want
00:44:12 you know i believe that you get it
00:44:14 through diligence and i've been looking
00:44:15 for bears for 30 years whatever
00:44:17 and so he brought catnip to he so he
00:44:20 could get the bear to come out i'm like
00:44:22 what the what's the deal so of course my
00:44:24 dad ends up going on some hike
00:44:26 and he sees a bear and he leaves the
00:44:28 catnip for as a tree he ends up leaving
00:44:30 and now i was so scared you know catnip
00:44:32 gets the cat's hype
00:44:33 right like it's like crack i'm like
00:44:34 please don't give crack to the bear
00:44:36 i don't think it works that way i was
00:44:37 just i hope to god that i don't know if
00:44:39 how would you know has anyone ever given
00:44:41 catnip to a bear i'm sure someone's
00:44:42 that's
00:44:42 very niche i'm pretty sure if one
00:44:44 person's done anything doesn't work
00:44:46 on dogs so why would it work on bears i
00:44:48 don't know dogs aren't bears i don't
00:44:50 know
00:44:50 they seem to be like more closer to dogs
00:44:52 like than cat like
00:44:54 well no bears ended up going ham and
00:44:56 doing anything
00:44:57 did your dad see a bear he was somewhere
00:45:00 on the east coast doing the show
00:45:02 there's plenty of places to see bears
00:45:03 you don't have to wait 30 years my dad
00:45:05 probably was lazy as hell and probably
00:45:07 said i looked everywhere probably opened
00:45:09 this front fucking door a bear wasn't
00:45:10 standing there and went back inside well
00:45:12 that's what people think
00:45:13 don't worry there's no bears left go
00:45:15 outside look we'll just go to the right
00:45:16 place i've seen bears
00:45:17 i went plenty of i spent a little bit of
00:45:20 time in vancouver bc with my brother
00:45:22 this is actually one of the crazier
00:45:23 things i've ever done people think i'm
00:45:24 so crazy but this is the craziest thing
00:45:26 but it's not even that nuts
00:45:28 i uh i was following like nat geo on
00:45:30 instagram and i love the pictures of the
00:45:32 spirit bears i love those like beautiful
00:45:34 bears up in bc
00:45:35 and uh i kind of started reading about
00:45:36 the wolf coal up there and i got really
00:45:38 kind of invested in these animals and
00:45:40 i sent a dm and said is there any way
00:45:42 that some point i could go with maybe
00:45:43 some of your researchers and i could see
00:45:45 some of these bears or wolves for myself
00:45:47 because
00:45:47 i think i'd be even more inspired to
00:45:49 kind of like fight for them if i could
00:45:51 actually
00:45:51 see them and know that they're really
00:45:52 real because i've only ever seen them
00:45:53 from a picture
00:45:54 and they responded and said sure you can
00:45:56 come up and hang with the spirit
00:45:57 this is kind of like i don't know if
00:45:58 it's catfishing or i don't know what was
00:46:00 really going on but someone's telling me
00:46:01 sure so me and my brother load up we
00:46:03 i didn't really want to get my parents
00:46:04 involved so we got a coach flight
00:46:06 and had to go through san francisco then
00:46:08 we got this shitty little hotel room
00:46:10 because we were just trying to
00:46:11 how i didn't know how to do it
00:46:12 everyone's always done my travel for me
00:46:14 managers and all these things so i
00:46:15 was just booking it so we ended up
00:46:17 taking like two little planes
00:46:19 three boats and we ended up getting two
00:46:22 um with this dude ian who shoots
00:46:24 and uh for nat geo and shoots up in bc
00:46:26 and it was just amazing and when i got
00:46:28 to see all the spirit bears
00:46:29 um i got to go into like where they do
00:46:31 all their research on their boat so
00:46:33 they'll leave these like uh kind of like
00:46:35 trap combs where they it just brushes
00:46:37 the bear's hair
00:46:38 when it when it walks by so they can
00:46:40 understand kind of more about
00:46:42 it and dna yeah i started looking about
00:46:44 like all this information again this is
00:46:46 one of the
00:46:47 kind of weirder things that i've done
00:46:48 that i i didn't really know
00:46:50 who was going to be waiting on that boat
00:46:51 i mean i know we tell girls not to go
00:46:53 out into the middle of a boat
00:46:54 how old were you when you were doing
00:46:55 this this was uh two weeks after
00:46:58 the vmas in 2015. so you're already
00:47:00 super famous
00:47:01 and you're super famous going out there
00:47:03 to find bears with my brother
00:47:05 there i am yeah there i am yeah
00:47:08 and that do you find that if you're not
00:47:10 glammed up yeah
00:47:12 you can kind of sneak around well this
00:47:13 is kind of funny because they
00:47:15 i think it's happening in a second they
00:47:16 gave me a caterpillar that if you lick
00:47:18 its belly your tongue goes numb
00:47:19 oh great and i pretended that i was it
00:47:21 might happen somewhere here oh yeah save
00:47:23 the bc wolves
00:47:24 but if like you don't wear makeup and
00:47:26 shit can you sneak around
00:47:28 um yeah i sneak around pretty good it's
00:47:30 the voice it's
00:47:31 not the makeup i just have to shut up
00:47:33 yeah
00:47:34 can you fuck with your voice and make it
00:47:35 high can you pretend
00:47:37 not really not really uh i have a phone
00:47:41 voice i think i i apparently you know i
00:47:43 directed this last video and apparently
00:47:45 when i read my presentations i have like
00:47:47 a different voice you know like when you
00:47:48 answer the phone
00:47:49 but i think it sounds the same my phone
00:47:51 voice i think is like
00:47:53 i think it just sounds the same mm-hmm
00:47:55 yeah so that's what gets you
00:47:57 that's what gets me yeah people know
00:47:59 yeah they're like wait what the listen
00:48:00 but the voice yeah exactly
00:48:04 that's the worst when you hear those
00:48:05 whispers yeah those are weird whispers
00:48:07 right yeah
00:48:08 yeah for sure your life of growing up
00:48:11 famous is that that doesn't end well
00:48:14 for most people you're remarkably
00:48:17 together
00:48:18 for someone who grew up famous you know
00:48:21 that's a
00:48:22 it's a weird way it's a weird alchemy to
00:48:25 put together a human being where
00:48:27 in your developmental stages pre-teen in
00:48:29 fact
00:48:30 you're hugely famous yeah what do what
00:48:33 do you think that did for you
00:48:36 what did it do do you think that's a
00:48:38 good thing or do you think it's
00:48:40 it's a manageable thing i would say it
00:48:42 isn't recommended
00:48:43 because like i kind of said in the
00:48:45 beginning of this it's it's like jumping
00:48:47 in the deep end of the pool and not
00:48:48 knowing if you can swim or not and it
00:48:50 can go one way or the other
00:48:51 luckily i swam but it almost always goes
00:48:53 the wrong way i know almost always
00:48:55 and that i don't think comes very
00:48:57 recommended and i i wouldn't recommend
00:48:59 it
00:48:59 um i don't know i don't know what it is
00:49:02 but i feel
00:49:03 uh i feel like
00:49:06 i've kind of been given this like
00:49:08 special i don't know
00:49:09 kind of special understanding of i don't
00:49:13 even know where it comes from because
00:49:14 i'm really not religious and and i
00:49:16 maybe it comes from like education of
00:49:18 getting a good understanding of
00:49:19 you know i've got kind of a good idea of
00:49:21 like what fame does on kind of like
00:49:23 if we're looking at it from a level of
00:49:25 were you thinking about this when you
00:49:26 were young
00:49:27 i wasn't thinking about this when i was
00:49:28 young but i started thinking about it uh
00:49:30 at the time where i think it kind of
00:49:31 mattered that i could go one way or the
00:49:33 other and that was probably when i was
00:49:35 17 and i bought dr amon's book
00:49:37 about understanding like kind of i i get
00:49:39 it why i can't get high enough
00:49:41 like on drugs and why i end up doing
00:49:43 more drugs than anybody else i wrote a
00:49:45 song where one of the lines says i'll go
00:49:47 toe-to-toe like i'm ali like i'll just
00:49:49 i'll do more they could be the biggest
00:49:50 guy in the room and i'll say i'll be
00:49:51 able to do more drugs than you
00:49:52 but it's because my level of what high
00:49:54 is
00:49:56 is i felt it from i mean when you're
00:49:58 having 15 000 people scream your name
00:50:00 and sing along to your songs it's like
00:50:01 you know how you're saying your float
00:50:02 tank is getting high without drugs it's
00:50:04 like that but times a billion
00:50:05 no i'm sure so it's really hard to to
00:50:07 come down off that
00:50:08 and uh i never luckily had a problem
00:50:10 with like taking downers to bring myself
00:50:12 down but there was a lot of people
00:50:14 around me that was like you know just
00:50:15 take half of these and you'll be fine
00:50:17 yeah you know so i'm lucky i didn't
00:50:19 start messing with downers i think it
00:50:20 also might have to do with your head
00:50:21 injury
00:50:22 yeah yeah i know that there's there's a
00:50:25 real big connection between people with
00:50:26 traumatic brain injury
00:50:28 and the the need for either alcohol or
00:50:31 cocaine
00:50:31 or absolutely something to perturb your
00:50:34 uh your natural state of consciousness
00:50:36 and a lot of my brain is really really
00:50:38 on
00:50:38 uh it's got like over activity but then
00:50:41 again if you kind of look at the part
00:50:42 that frontal lobe that kind of tells you
00:50:44 you know yes or no or stops you from
00:50:46 making a bad choice mine gets a little
00:50:48 sleepy sometimes when i'm not doing
00:50:50 especially when it comes to the diet
00:50:51 when my diet
00:50:52 isn't you know it's it's it's annoying
00:50:54 because
00:50:55 i do like to want them country so i like
00:50:58 to eat bad food i i had never
00:51:00 my mom used to get mad if i would tell
00:51:01 her i don't want butter like my mom is
00:51:03 like
00:51:04 great for you yeah now i'm fine and but
00:51:07 i just remember growing up by my mom

00:51:12 that we don't know anything about
00:51:13 nutrition i
00:51:14 i grew up on that country diet and so i
00:51:17 learned a lot i honestly i mark a lot of
00:51:19 um
00:51:21 my i guess kind of like my grounding in
00:51:23 the weight that i have to my diet to my
00:51:25 supplementing to
00:51:27 my my maintenance to the diligence to

00:52:28 yeah yeah we played jolene your your
00:52:30 you're covered julian on this podcast
00:52:32 once
00:52:33 thank you very much yeah thank you no
00:52:35 when a lot of kids kind of think that's
00:52:36 my song now that's what i like doing
00:52:38 about covers i think you were talking
00:52:40 about
00:52:40 uh that cornell tribute at one point
00:52:42 also and yeah that's what i love my fans
00:52:44 you know they they wouldn't really know
00:52:47 unless i introduced it to them
00:52:49 and that's something that i really love
00:52:50 and that happened recently with midnight
00:52:51 sky and stevie nicks uh there's a sample
00:52:54 of edges 17 which i got
00:52:56 i got blessed by her to be able to allow
00:52:58 me to do it i had another melody
00:53:00 a b melody it's definitely below a b
00:53:03 because it's not edge of 17 which is my
00:53:04 top five favorite song ever
00:53:06 and she said you can borrow from me
00:53:08 anytime which like
00:53:10 that's awesome so cool yeah yeah that's
00:53:12 gotta be pretty badass
00:53:14 to be able to be in contact and and to
00:53:16 collaborate with all these
00:53:18 amazing artists and i went on the road
00:53:20 with joan jet for a little while too
00:53:21 when she was
00:53:22 on on tour with the who uh i went and
00:53:24 hung out with her for a little while
00:53:26 for a little while that's amazing you
00:53:27 know even if i'd show up there and i'd
00:53:28 maybe been partying too much and she
00:53:29 would yell
00:53:30 her manager kenny who's you know been
00:53:32 her manager and her band from the
00:53:34 beginning
00:53:34 kenny we gotta get her like some mexican
00:53:37 food or something look at her like she's
00:53:39 like
00:53:40 she's gonna break in half and you know
00:53:41 all of a sudden all this food starts
00:53:43 showing up my room and
00:53:44 you know i think she's probably seen you
00:53:46 know not just in her own band
00:53:48 but you know um i think she's seen
00:53:51 everything and i think she's seen it go
00:53:52 the wrong way you know how we're talking
00:53:53 about whether you swim or drown i think
00:53:55 she's seen a lot more people drown and
00:53:56 so she always tries to feed me
00:53:58 but that's where it's got to be really
00:53:59 hard if you're a woman like her who's
00:54:00 been there done that and then you see
00:54:02 some young girl coming up
00:54:03 and you're like damn this this lady
00:54:05 right now is in the waves
00:54:07 and you know and you've been in the
00:54:08 waves many times where
00:54:10 that ship is rocking back and forth and
00:54:12 you don't know which way it's going to
00:54:13 go yeah when you're a 17 year old kid
00:54:15 and you're doing a lot of mushrooms and
00:54:16 smoking a lot of pot
00:54:18 and and also you're super fucking famous
00:54:20 and really people can't tell you shit
00:54:22 yeah which is part of the problem i know
00:54:24 that's why my mom's the best
00:54:25 i didn't understand she was the best at
00:54:27 the time she's still taking my cell
00:54:28 phone i'm like how can you take it i'm
00:54:30 paying for it and she's like i gave you
00:54:32 life shut up um you know and
00:54:35 yeah my mom still took my cell phone
00:54:36 until i was almost 20. you have like
00:54:39 an almost manic way of talking yeah your
00:54:42 way of talking is almost like a fountain
00:54:44 like a crazy fountain like words just
00:54:46 keep coming and ideas just keep coming i
00:54:49 know like how do you
00:54:50 how do you shut that off uh i am into
00:54:53 a lot of these i love the idea of these
00:54:55 hypnosis apps i have a lot of those
00:54:57 which ones are you use
00:54:58 i like uh i like amen clinics so i'm all
00:55:00 about my boy dr ehman
00:55:02 um i listen to headspace a lot
00:55:05 and i like calm i use that a lot also
00:55:07 sounds great yes i actually my favorite
00:55:09 thing about headspace is i love the
00:55:11 um the sleep skate and my favorite one
00:55:13 is the cat marina
00:55:15 because i do love boats and i do love
00:55:17 cats so that's a dream for me after a
00:55:19 long day
00:55:21 does that work on youtube when my house
00:55:23 burned down
00:55:24 i literally i'm not joking the cat
00:55:26 marina got me through i was standing in
00:55:28 south africa and every night it'd be
00:55:29 like
00:55:30 hello and good evening you're at the cat
00:55:33 marina
00:55:34 lucky for you you love cats what do you
00:55:37 love more
00:55:37 boats you know and it's like hell yeah
00:55:40 i'm at the cat marina
00:55:41 my house is on the ground in a million
00:55:43 pieces and i'll never see anything that
00:55:44 i loved inside of again but
00:55:45 i'm at the fucking cat marina i'm not a
00:55:47 doctor but if i was i would tell i would
00:55:49 prescribe to you
00:55:50 some ridiculous rigorous exercise i
00:55:53 think you are
00:55:55 you're like a little ferrari and you
00:55:56 need to get out there on the fucking
00:55:58 racetrack well let's go
00:55:59 i really think that like i see all this
00:56:01 fucking energy you have i'm like that
00:56:03 like that lady's like an overflowing
00:56:05 battery this is why i like this is why i
00:56:07 like to work hard and maybe
00:56:08 that's i'm sure yeah i love to wear
00:56:10 you're a thoroughbred
00:56:11 i do and when i don't work that's when i
00:56:12 get in trouble but you also got to think
00:56:14 about there's
00:56:15 genetics involved you know your father
00:56:17 was a musician and you know just
00:56:19 and then all your life being in the
00:56:21 public eye like that and performing and
00:56:23 working and then
00:56:24 just the amount of effort that you put
00:56:26 in when you were a kid
00:56:28 touring all the time i mean you're
00:56:30 fucking
00:56:31 geared for that shit you know and i just
00:56:33 feel like people like that
00:56:35 your body can betray you sometimes if
00:56:37 you don't i have a lot of physical pain
00:56:39 to be honest with you um and that's
00:56:41 something i'm working on and trying to
00:56:42 figure out too and that had a lot
00:56:44 you got physical pain physical pain my
00:56:46 hips like really really hurt me and
00:56:48 my hips drive me crazy like if i fly i
00:56:51 think i don't know maybe it's just
00:56:53 the do you stretch i do stretch i'm
00:56:55 actually overly flexible i'm like kind
00:56:57 of double jointed everywhere
00:56:59 um and so i have a lot of like shoulder
00:57:00 like my shoulder will just slip out
00:57:02 what all the time like it kind of just
00:57:04 does weird things and my arms twist in
00:57:06 weird directions
00:57:07 are you physically strong physically
00:57:09 strong i think i'm pretty strong i've
00:57:10 been stronger i've been stronger maybe
00:57:12 it's like a muscle thing maybe you need
00:57:14 to exercise
00:57:14 but i i really really loved
00:57:18 lifting and um doing all my weight
00:57:20 training my resistance and then the kind
00:57:22 of
00:57:22 the veganism i was kind of trying to i
00:57:24 think i'm really kind of building myself
00:57:26 back
00:57:26 up to realize what works on actually
00:57:28 right now in a very experimental period
00:57:30 it's actually fun to talk about with you
00:57:31 because i know that you kind of
00:57:33 have probably some good suggestions on
00:57:35 that but i'm
00:57:36 experimenting a lot with like my diet
00:57:38 and my body and my routine
00:57:40 and my exercise right now um because i
00:57:43 mean
00:57:44 kind of like you know leaving veganism
00:57:47 and is really terrifying like you said
00:57:49 the public kind of will destroy you for
00:57:51 that
00:57:51 how long were you vegan uh since i was
00:57:54 vegan from
00:57:55 2013 until 2019.
00:57:58 so in 2019 what was the first thing that
00:58:00 you ate
00:58:02 my my ex-husband cooked me cooked me
00:58:04 some fish on the grill
00:58:07 i cried like for a long time i cried for
00:58:10 the fish and i
00:58:10 was a little fucks they didn't take care
00:58:12 of their kids listen i have some videos
00:58:14 on my phone of my fish at home i have a
00:58:16 blow fish that runs to the side of the
00:58:18 tank every time i come home so it really
00:58:19 hurts me to eat
00:58:20 because it thinks you're going to feed
00:58:21 it and i do every time yeah that's it
00:58:25 you know what i haven't really had you
00:58:26 get shot in the head that fish doesn't
00:58:27 give a fuck
00:58:28 well that's what that's what my ex said
00:58:30 about the dogs and i'm like i can't do
00:58:31 this the dogs and he's like
00:58:33 watch this starts feeding them the fish
00:58:34 they're like they're happy you know
00:58:35 they'll eat it
00:58:36 but um so that's what i had and it was
00:58:38 because of a hip pain i had uh actually
00:58:40 going
00:58:41 to we were flying to i think poland or
00:58:43 something
00:58:44 on a tour that i was on and i started
00:58:46 sobbing crying on the plane because i
00:58:47 couldn't sit any longer because my hips
00:58:48 are hurting so bad
00:58:49 so this was pretty laying on the floor
00:58:51 pre-quitting gluten
00:58:53 now i'm back on gluten i did a trial
00:58:56 period of 18 of of like kind of removing
00:58:59 things because i think when you try all
00:59:00 these different diets like
00:59:01 okay now i'm gonna try keto now i'm
00:59:02 gonna try vegan now i'm gonna try this
00:59:04 you're doing it
00:59:05 at such a kind of it's really hard to
00:59:07 know what's affecting you
00:59:08 um so i tried to go slowly like okay it
00:59:11 takes a
00:59:12 freaking long time but going through and
00:59:13 going i'm gonna eliminate this now and
00:59:15 then i'm gonna put it back and see how i
00:59:16 feel
00:59:17 my body when i am supplementing
00:59:20 especially with the omegas like the
00:59:22 omegas have really changed my life for
00:59:23 me i think again you know you kind of
00:59:26 you kind of refer to me as something
00:59:27 like a car and i think that we are kind
00:59:29 of like a car and i was like
00:59:30 so dry from having none of these healthy
00:59:32 fats in my diet i did what i could with
00:59:34 like as many
00:59:34 freaking avocados a day as like things
00:59:36 but it's hard to get the fat
00:59:38 it's not as bio available and your brain
00:59:40 is you know your brain really needs
00:59:42 those fats and
00:59:43 you know it was really really hard for
00:59:45 me fish oil is the way to go
00:59:46 i know people don't like it and they
00:59:48 don't like the idea behind it if
00:59:50 but god damn it's so good for your brain
00:59:52 yeah i love uh
00:59:53 i do kind of like the fish egg vital
00:59:55 choice also because that sounds great i
00:59:57 love that fish eggs the way to go
00:59:58 that's what i do yeah i mean that's the
01:00:00 best way to get yourself so much
01:00:02 now that's an inflammation issue then
01:00:04 yes yeah yeah i think in general my
01:00:06 brain like you're saying it's kind of on
01:00:07 fire it is inflamed
01:00:08 i think in general i'm inflamed so i'm
01:00:10 looking for
01:00:11 in my life not just in kind of like
01:00:14 dating or relationships but in general
01:00:15 the people i like to have around
01:00:17 i like to have those kind of water signs
01:00:19 i like someone that can kind of or
01:00:20 earth science but i love water science
01:00:22 because i love being
01:00:24 and in general like i love people that
01:00:26 are kind of like fluid
01:00:28 and that can kind of put some of that on
01:00:30 my flame because
01:00:31 it's it gets overwhelming sometimes the
01:00:33 amount of heat and like energy that i
01:00:35 generate
01:00:36 i actually was reading something about
01:00:37 ducks that's interesting the way the
01:00:38 ducks handled their energy
01:00:40 ducks yes how do they handle the energy
01:00:42 so ducks you know
01:00:44 i guess their form of exercise so
01:00:45 apparently i was reading this in a book
01:00:47 last night i don't know if it's
01:00:48 i guess it goes with my real realistic
01:00:50 children's stories
01:00:51 but i was reading about ducks how they
01:00:54 like kind of ferociously uh flap their
01:00:56 wings
01:00:57 and then they kind of swim off in peace
01:00:59 and you'll kind of you'll
01:01:00 see these weird kind of uh patterns that
01:01:02 they do and especially if two ducks are
01:01:04 together so
01:01:04 you throw a piece of bread in the water
01:01:06 one of the ducks get it they get a
01:01:07 little
01:01:08 fight going on then they both separate
01:01:10 ways they go to their own spot and start
01:01:12 flapping their wings all crazy to get
01:01:14 out some of that energy
01:01:16 and then they just swim away in peace
01:01:18 and i'm like i guess that's kind of what
01:01:19 you're saying that i need i need to be
01:01:20 more duck like i need
01:01:21 to whether it's the beginning of the day
01:01:23 or the end of the day i need something
01:01:25 to go and like flap my wings and get out
01:01:27 that extra energy because i think that's
01:01:28 part of the physical pain
01:01:30 like when i when i went to go check in
01:01:32 on the pain before and i've been to a
01:01:33 lot of people
01:01:34 here and no one seemed to help me with
01:01:37 the physical
01:01:38 pain it actually gets really really bad
01:01:39 like especially if i fly i usually have
01:01:41 to lay on the ground
01:01:43 because my back hurts me so bad and my
01:01:44 hips hurt me so bad that's crazy i know
01:01:47 for you to be this young yeah that's
01:01:48 crazy and there's no real injuries you
01:01:50 could point to this that caused them
01:01:52 so i over did a stronger yoga for a
01:01:54 couple years because i am extremist
01:01:56 right and some there's a little
01:01:58 controversy between ashtanga yoga
01:02:00 and the kind of like hip injuries yeah
01:02:03 hip injuries
01:02:06 and everything looks good you know
01:02:07 everyone says we have no idea
01:02:09 you know kind of what's going on but
01:02:12 they're not really taking into
01:02:13 consideration my lifestyle
01:02:15 but that has to do something you know i
01:02:16 have to put it somewhere this amount of
01:02:18 energy
01:02:19 i don't always get it out you're right i
01:02:21 need to freaking run more you know what
01:02:22 the running helped me a lot when the
01:02:24 house burned down too in south africa i
01:02:25 was running every day
01:02:26 yeah i would think that someone like you
01:02:28 you need something rigorous
01:02:30 if i don't work out i'm not a great
01:02:34 person yeah that's what i'm saying yeah
01:02:35 i can guarantee you oh yeah i no one we
01:02:38 don't do
01:02:38 calls or work meetings before i work out
01:02:40 that's a we know this
01:02:42 okay we've learned from the past that
01:02:45 you have a trainer very important yeah i
01:02:46 do
01:02:47 is it a good trainer trainer but i need
01:02:50 to
01:02:52 i think in times where
01:02:55 my trainer is kind of like family like
01:02:57 for me now and maybe
01:02:58 getting a little too so too comfortable
01:03:01 a little too soft in the way that
01:03:03 when i'm going through like you know
01:03:04 this week i went through
01:03:06 like another public breakup i had the
01:03:07 vmas the song was coming out at the same
01:03:10 time and when i got into the gym like i
01:03:12 would sometimes just start crying
01:03:13 because i love them like families when
01:03:15 you walk in i would just start crying
01:03:16 because you
01:03:17 know that you could be comfortable right
01:03:18 it's comfortable and then i think that
01:03:20 it's hard to go okay now i'm gonna beat
01:03:21 your ass because i think he thinks life
01:03:22 is beating my ass but maybe i need just
01:03:25 maybe you separate those things exactly
01:03:27 yeah there's a job to be done yeah all
01:03:29 that emotion's great and it's wonderful
01:03:31 that he loves you and you guys are
01:03:32 friends
01:03:33 i think it's a little bit my my bad for
01:03:35 like wondering how hard i want to be
01:03:37 pushed
01:03:37 well it's also you're the boss that's
01:03:39 the problem when you're the boss
01:03:40 and you're miley cyrus you can't say
01:03:42 listen bitch it's time to go to work
01:03:43 yeah you know
01:03:44 he'll do it to me sometimes which i like
01:03:47 yeah you can't do it too much because
01:03:48 then you're like no no i'm the fucking
01:03:49 boss and then
01:03:50 you guys well then i think relationship
01:03:52 then i think i
01:03:53 i want to kind of i don't know what it
01:03:55 is not give up but then i think
01:03:57 sometimes
01:03:58 i wonder how much and i really don't
01:04:00 even like saying this because i kind of
01:04:01 have guilt for my life like i don't mean
01:04:03 it's too much like i can't take anything
01:04:05 else like i
01:04:06 know that i don't have the hardest life
01:04:08 i know how lucky i am
01:04:09 but i know that don't you don't need to
01:04:11 compare because just what
01:04:13 what you do is very difficult don't make
01:04:15 any
01:04:16 mistake about that i have a hard time
01:04:18 with that i feel very guilty
01:04:19 nonsense throw someone else into your
01:04:21 existence like first of all a
01:04:23 you didn't choose it okay you were a
01:04:24 little kid and he became famous
01:04:26 b being in the public eye and just
01:04:28 dealing with the things we're talking
01:04:29 about about
01:04:30 people writing stories that are fake
01:04:31 about you all that stuff comes at a
01:04:33 price
01:04:34 and if you read it it comes at a heavier
01:04:35 price but even just knowing it exists
01:04:38 get it gets in your head you have to be
01:04:40 very strong to be able to ward that off
01:04:42 and the idea that you don't and that
01:04:43 it's easy
01:04:44 and that a regular life is easier
01:04:46 horseshit regular life is just a regular
01:04:48 life
01:04:49 it's not easier or harder but what you
01:04:51 do is fucking hard
01:04:53 it's very hard you're very famous being
01:04:55 very famous is weird
01:04:57 and being very famous your whole life is
01:04:59 even weirder
01:05:00 so a normal person develops right you go
01:05:03 through life and you meet friends and
01:05:05 you have to show that you're a good
01:05:06 person to get people to like you
01:05:08 you have to show you know some sort of
01:05:11 uh
01:05:12 some excellence it's something for
01:05:14 people to praise you
01:05:15 you're getting fucking praise from the
01:05:17 time you're a baby basically
01:05:19 it's a weird way to develop yes and so
01:05:21 for you to reach adulthood and try to be
01:05:24 conscious
01:05:24 and try to be sentient and try to like
01:05:26 to just
01:05:28 stay balanced it's you're dealing with a
01:05:31 situation that
01:05:34 99.999 percent of the population has no
01:05:36 fucking idea what you're handling yeah
01:05:38 the only people that are going to
01:05:39 understand it are people that also grew
01:05:40 up famous
01:05:41 yeah which i have a hard time with
01:05:43 because
01:05:45 i haven't made that exactly my peer
01:05:47 group and now i kind of
01:05:48 am like i think i've been really
01:05:49 searching for some sort of normalcy in
01:05:51 my life
01:05:52 and for sure and so i think i haven't
01:05:55 surrounded myself with the top
01:05:58 of of kind of people that are also at
01:06:00 this
01:06:01 at this level um because i feel i have a
01:06:05 lot of guilt like i feel like i would
01:06:07 be i feel like that would make me
01:06:09 shallow or something for only
01:06:11 surrounding myself for like rich and
01:06:13 famous people
01:06:14 right now but people do that because of
01:06:15 the only ones that can relate to you
01:06:17 and that's what i'm working on you feel
01:06:18 like people that are regular folks
01:06:20 they treat you weird or they they they
01:06:23 like you more than they should or that
01:06:26 they
01:06:26 you know they praise you more than they
01:06:28 should because you're an alien yeah
01:06:30 you're this we're like oh she's fair
01:06:31 she's working miley cyrus yeah you're
01:06:32 not like a regular person that walks
01:06:34 into a room and you'll never be a
01:06:35 regular person
01:06:36 and i think rather than trying to prove
01:06:38 like excellence in any way when i walk
01:06:40 in a room i try to prove really hard
01:06:41 that i'm
01:06:41 that you're normal yeah that's
01:06:44 exhausting yeah
01:06:45 but i don't want to be normal which is
01:06:46 funny so because it's kind of like
01:06:48 you make a goal you know i do this with
01:06:50 eamon about making a goal and then going
01:06:52 towards what i want it's like i don't
01:06:53 want to be normal
01:06:54 yeah but i i constantly struggle with am
01:06:57 i
01:06:57 a fucking rich asshole well this is the
01:07:00 beautiful thing the beautiful thing is
01:07:01 that you're thinking
01:07:03 you're thinking about all this you're
01:07:04 balancing it out but this is not a path
01:07:06 that very many people have gone through
01:07:08 successfully
01:07:09 yeah and so that's why you have to be
01:07:10 careful because you're here right now
01:07:12 you're okay
01:07:12 like right now mary's miley cyrus in
01:07:14 2020 you're great
01:07:16 you're good i mean you've gone through
01:07:17 divorce you've gone through this you've
01:07:19 gone through that
01:07:19 but you're right here right now you're
01:07:21 okay yeah the path forward
01:07:23 is treacherous it is going to be because
01:07:26 you didn't develop like a normal person
01:07:29 every fucking child star i mean like
01:07:31 maybe like jodie foster like how many
01:07:33 how many of them made it through
01:07:34 and see and i don't know her maybe that
01:07:36 lady's crazy she's an amazing actress
01:07:38 right
01:07:38 there's a few that made it through
01:07:39 there's not many yeah and it's not a
01:07:42 good path
01:07:43 it's not a path that i would ever
01:07:44 recommend to somebody and once you've
01:07:45 gone through it
01:07:46 there's no way to go back and do it all
01:07:48 over again right but i say with
01:07:49 confidence that i feel like i could be
01:07:51 the one
01:07:52 because i i feel like
01:07:56 i don't expect it to be easy and i don't
01:07:59 even want it to be
01:08:01 actually i had a guy trying to be
01:08:02 shitting me one time said you want a guy
01:08:04 that'll just do whatever you want i said
01:08:05 that's where you're wrong
01:08:07 i want like all the challenging things
01:08:09 if it's something that's easy i don't
01:08:10 fucking want it i never have that's why
01:08:12 i didn't keep living my life in
01:08:14 nashville where we were the biggest fish
01:08:16 in the small
01:08:16 pond and all that kind of thing you know
01:08:18 i needed more
01:08:19 and the reason why i say that with
01:08:21 confidence is because i'm really willing
01:08:23 to do the work
01:08:24 and i'm also i'm willing to look at
01:08:26 myself from a human level
01:08:28 and also look at like what my body needs
01:08:31 to thrive
01:08:33 and i know that it can't be cocaine for
01:08:34 me and i know that it can't be alcohol
01:08:36 and i know that unfortunately i love
01:08:38 fucking fish but at this point i gotta
01:08:39 eat it
01:08:40 to be able to have my brain to work as
01:08:41 quickly as you and i are going right now
01:08:43 or
01:08:43 what i have to do later today and going
01:08:45 to the studio tonight and
01:08:47 i i understand myself from a human
01:08:51 there's nothing about me that thinks i
01:08:52 am superhuman and i think that
01:08:55 i think i would i would take that as
01:08:57 something that
01:08:59 that makes me unique because i don't
01:09:00 think that i'm really i know that
01:09:02 there's something special about me in my
01:09:04 life
01:09:04 but i don't feel that on this level of
01:09:07 of being a human that i'm different and
01:09:09 so i know what it takes to keep
01:09:11 this motor going and and i also know
01:09:14 when to take time
01:09:15 well all those things you said are
01:09:16 perfect as long as you have doubt
01:09:18 as long as you want to do better as long
01:09:20 as you're recognizing
01:09:21 who you are is not exactly who you want
01:09:24 to be
01:09:24 yeah you want to be better you want to
01:09:26 figure it all out you want to work it
01:09:27 all through
01:09:28 and you have this weird guilt from
01:09:30 growing up in this weird way
01:09:31 it has to be you're a fucking superstar
01:09:33 when you're a little kid the guilt's
01:09:35 crazy there's no way around it and if
01:09:36 you hang out with normal people they're
01:09:37 going to stick that in your face
01:09:39 a lot of people hold my guilt they know
01:09:41 it's a weakness so they use it with me a
01:09:42 lot you got to find people that don't do
01:09:44 that
01:09:44 yeah that's why my my crew is pretty
01:09:46 small beautiful well they're all nice
01:09:48 people they are all been my in my life
01:09:49 for over 10 years and that is possible
01:09:51 people ask people that are famous like
01:09:53 is it possible that you could find
01:09:55 people that
01:09:56 don't get weird around you yeah you
01:09:57 could find them but they have to be
01:09:59 strong people
01:10:00 exactly you have to have people that
01:10:02 have their own personal sovereignty they
01:10:03 have people that can
01:10:04 hold their own space they don't need you
01:10:06 they just love you
01:10:07 yeah and that is possible man you know i
01:10:09 had someone that
01:10:11 that tried to try to hurt me and say
01:10:13 that
01:10:14 i mean i i really have had i've i've had
01:10:17 really amazing people in my life but
01:10:19 i've had people that have tried to hurt
01:10:20 me too i even brought my little scarf
01:10:21 just in case i got
01:10:22 emotional because i really might i had
01:10:24 someone recently try to tell me that
01:10:26 everyone in my life is afraid of me
01:10:28 and that like that really makes me upset
01:10:30 just because well i bet a lot of people
01:10:32 in your life are afraid
01:10:33 i think everyone in my life that i have
01:10:34 in my close inner circle
01:10:36 really loves me and so to say that
01:10:38 everyone in my life
01:10:40 acts out of fear of me my mom i'm almost
01:10:42 fucking 30. she will whip my ass
01:10:44 like my mom will actually hit me but i
01:10:46 don't mean it in a bad way
01:10:47 i don't mean that they're afraid of you
01:10:49 like like afraid you're going to do
01:10:50 something terrible and they're afraid
01:10:51 around you i mean
01:10:53 you're a powerful thing you're you mean
01:10:55 this there's no getting away from who
01:10:57 you are
01:10:58 you got to kind of accept that you're
01:11:00 miley cyrus that yeah that's a very
01:11:02 strange thing
01:11:03 there's no there's one miley cyrus on in
01:11:05 the universe that we know of it's you
01:11:07 and you're really fucking famous and
01:11:08 you're really young that's weird
01:11:10 there's no getting around that yeah and
01:11:12 the fact that you feel guilt about all
01:11:14 this and the fact you want things to be
01:11:15 difficult
01:11:16 those are all the the best indicators
01:11:18 that you're trying to do better
01:11:19 yeah like you get it yes you do get it
01:11:21 and you know that you have a hard road
01:11:22 and the people that don't think you have
01:11:24 a hard road they're out of their fucking
01:11:25 mind
01:11:26 like i didn't get famous until it was
01:11:27 much later in life and it was a slow
01:11:29 drip
01:11:30 into my 30s and into my 40s that seemed
01:11:32 to help cheer
01:11:33 it was way healthier that seems healthy
01:11:34 but i also during the whole time did
01:11:36 martial arts
01:11:37 yeah so i was always humbled i was
01:11:38 always getting my ass kicked yeah and i
01:11:40 feel like those two things are the only
01:11:41 things that save me from
01:11:43 my own brain yeah because you're you're
01:11:46 like people
01:11:46 are not designed to be famous yeah
01:11:49 that's why kings are all tyrants
01:11:50 yeah when you view the one person who
01:11:52 gets to make all the calls absolute
01:11:54 power can
01:11:55 it corrupts absolutely it's a common
01:11:57 expression right yes
01:11:58 that happens with famous i'm trying to
01:12:00 have a good relationship with the power
01:12:01 and feel feel a healthy dynamic the way
01:12:04 you're describing it is perfect
01:12:05 how many like look the ellen situation i
01:12:08 don't know ellen
01:12:08 she's probably a nice lady but she's in
01:12:10 control she's in control of all these
01:12:12 people they're all scared of her she's
01:12:13 like fuck you where's my tea
01:12:14 you know that that kind of shit that's
01:12:16 not a good place for a person to be
01:12:19 yeah to have that control
01:12:22 that i don't live in that world and i
01:12:24 think i could probably also mark that up
01:12:26 to animals and how much i love them and
01:12:28 i think that's what led to my veganism
01:12:30 for a time was like
01:12:31 the fact that tonight i have to put
01:12:33 powder on my dog's ass
01:12:34 that makes me happy i don't get with the
01:12:36 power apparently
01:12:37 i think it kind of just hopefully
01:12:39 conceals
01:12:40 in some way how disgusting it's very
01:12:44 very
01:12:45 out there and in your face and i think
01:12:48 it's more of like a concealer
01:12:50 um but i'm really happy that kate moss
01:12:52 hey guys i gotta say kate moss makes me
01:12:54 put baby powder on her ass just use that
01:12:56 as the teaser
01:12:57 [Laughter]
01:12:59 one time kate moss made me put baby
01:13:00 powder on ass it's called monkey butt
01:13:02 so i um that that makes me happy and
01:13:04 like my
01:13:05 one of my dogs he's obsessed with
01:13:07 drinking out of the pool and so he like
01:13:08 throws up all the time and it's
01:13:10 disgusting and it all it seems always
01:13:12 makes me happy
01:13:13 and the one thing that i like about my
01:13:14 dogs that they don't know who i am
01:13:16 i mean they know that they got a good
01:13:17 living situation they're probably like i
01:13:18 wonder what she does for a living
01:13:20 but because their life is pretty good
01:13:21 and they get to go to other cool places
01:13:23 also
01:13:24 um but yeah my dogs don't know who i am
01:13:26 so i like that
01:13:27 and the cats scratch the shit out of me
01:13:28 all the time and the pigs are horrible
01:13:29 they bite my ankles i love it about them
01:13:31 yeah well i bet that's
01:13:33 one of the ways you achieve balance is
01:13:35 through animals that's probably why you
01:13:36 like them so much
01:13:36 because they don't treat you like you're
01:13:38 an alien they just treat you like your
01:13:40 mama
01:13:41 exactly and they yeah their their
01:13:43 appreciation and gratitude level is
01:13:44 something that i aspire
01:13:46 to uh kind of recreate in my own life i
01:13:48 love how gracious they are
01:13:50 i think i i really respect the way
01:13:52 you're looking at things
01:13:54 i like i like the fact that you know
01:13:56 that you're in this weird situation and
01:13:58 you actually feel guilty for it i don't
01:14:00 think it's necessarily good to feel
01:14:01 guilty but the fact that you do
01:14:03 yeah is strong because it shows that
01:14:05 you're conscious of how weird it is
01:14:07 yeah and you know we've been working on
01:14:08 my guilt a lot and what's funny is like
01:14:10 i always want to cancel therapy when
01:14:12 nothing's going on which i guess is when
01:14:13 we kind of need it but i always want to
01:14:15 cancel it
01:14:16 and then we start talking about guilt
01:14:17 and like we got it you know we got to
01:14:18 work on your guilt whatever but i'm like
01:14:19 i only call you out of guilt i don't
01:14:21 want to do therapy and i don't even want
01:14:22 to talk to you
01:14:23 about what's going on in my life so we
01:14:25 can't get rid of it too much because
01:14:26 guilt makes us do good things i feel the
01:14:27 same way about fear and anxiety
01:14:29 healthy to your healthy anxiety that's
01:14:31 one of the things i like about weed
01:14:32 that's the most
01:14:33 i like to get scared do you like to get
01:14:36 scared oh yeah i like to see the devil
01:14:37 that's my friend joey diaz says i don't
01:14:39 like that anymore i like to see the
01:14:41 devil i do not like i like to be
01:14:42 paranoid i like to freak out
01:14:44 i had i had a very great ayahuasca
01:14:46 experience that i saw some things i saw
01:14:49 like um
01:14:50 i guess people take ayahuasca a couple
01:14:52 of times end up seeing these snakes that
01:14:54 end up like
01:14:54 taking you underground and you kind of
01:14:56 meet mama ayahuasca and she walks you
01:14:58 through everything
01:14:59 so ayahuasca the woman that i was seeing
01:15:02 it was at the time where i just kind of
01:15:04 started to become uh like
01:15:06 really dedicated to the veganism and she
01:15:08 reached down my throat and pulled out
01:15:10 every dead animal i had ever eaten and
01:15:11 made me throw it up
01:15:13 but i didn't see the animal that it was
01:15:16 like i didn't see like a cow or pig or
01:15:18 chicken like i saw me puking up all the
01:15:20 animals i saw me picking up
01:15:21 seals puking up a seal not fun elephants
01:15:24 all these different animals and i would
01:15:25 see all the animals coming
01:15:27 out of my body and uh you're not
01:15:29 supposed to have like a companion
01:15:30 in your ayahuasca trip it's supposed to
01:15:31 be just about you but i uh
01:15:33 you know it like my life the good perks
01:15:35 i got special treatment i could have my
01:15:37 dog
01:15:37 so i had my dog and i held my dog the
01:15:39 entire time and i and i had a
01:15:41 really really intense trip but since
01:15:42 then i haven't really loved getting high
01:15:44 as much as i used to
01:15:46 it like unlocked something uh now i'm
01:15:48 like i just don't want to puke up seals
01:15:50 again
01:15:50 well that sounds like you were dealing
01:15:52 with some sort of personal
01:15:54 i was dealing with guilt yeah not just
01:15:56 guilt for being famous but also
01:15:58 guilt for killing other lives to feed
01:16:01 your own life that you already feel
01:16:02 guilty for
01:16:03 yes it's all psychologically connected
01:16:05 like what you
01:16:06 see through psychedelics is
01:16:09 in it's not just the psychedelic
01:16:12 it's what you bring to the psychedelic
01:16:14 that's why set and setting is so
01:16:16 important well you're supposed to be
01:16:17 sober
01:16:18 i think two weeks before you actually do
01:16:20 the ayahuasca which i was the only one
01:16:21 that didn't do that yeah i don't know if
01:16:22 that's necessary
01:16:24 i got a little crazy crazy tmt will take
01:16:25 you there no matter what i've done some
01:16:27 good dmt
01:16:28 so all my personalities greet me one
01:16:30 time on dmt
01:16:31 all my personalities i saw and then i
01:16:33 was like i saw me as like a really ugly
01:16:35 crier and then like he's screaming
01:16:37 yelling at people and i it was nice
01:16:39 as i was sitting on the couch as it
01:16:40 started to hit me they almost kind of
01:16:42 like accordioned back into my body
01:16:44 you know my personality the thing about
01:16:45 all this craziness and the
01:16:47 the manic behavior and all of your
01:16:51 guilt and all of your anxiety there's
01:16:54 something that comes out in your music
01:16:56 there's some there's some of that that
01:16:58 comes out in this energy
01:17:00 when you sing and i don't know if it
01:17:02 would be there without it i i think
01:17:04 all brilliant artists are crazy i mean
01:17:07 i've never met one that isn't there's
01:17:08 something that they have
01:17:10 when you know they're they're bottling
01:17:12 it all up inside
01:17:13 and whether it's they're playing the
01:17:14 guitar or what they're saying and when
01:17:16 they sing it comes out
01:17:17 yeah you know and when you sing it comes
01:17:19 out but it's kind of that tight it's
01:17:21 kind of new also like it's coming out in
01:17:23 a whole nother way
01:17:24 you know i i look at it you're different
01:17:26 i'm very different and i honestly feel
01:17:28 like
01:17:30 my voice changed a lot after the fire i
01:17:32 could sing better after the fire in some
01:17:34 way it's almost like it like unleashed
01:17:36 something yeah like it did and like
01:17:39 maybe that's what it is
01:17:40 maybe i earned it maybe that's what it
01:17:42 is because i noticed that
01:17:44 my voice got better as i
01:17:47 well it's also probably you're more
01:17:49 comfortable with who you are having gone
01:17:51 through that yeah
01:17:52 the thing about having like a really not
01:17:54 an easy life but a privileged life like
01:17:57 you've you know you've had
01:17:58 so many doors open to you and so much
01:18:01 wealth and so much success like
01:18:03 when you do something hard or something
01:18:05 hard happens to you
01:18:07 at least you go okay i got through that
01:18:09 that was real yeah like i earned that i
01:18:10 earned
01:18:11 my my point of view my place of peace
01:18:15 after a storm yeah and every storm that
01:18:17 you go through
01:18:18 like that's why when you listen to
01:18:20 johnny cash saying her
01:18:21 man i mean that is like how old was he
01:18:24 when he did that cover he was like
01:18:26 80. yeah i was that's awesome
01:18:29 yeah god damn you hear that voice and
01:18:31 it's like
01:18:32 there's something that gives me thinking
01:18:34 about it right
01:18:35 there's something that comes through in
01:18:38 the in the
01:18:39 muse in the voice there's something that
01:18:41 comes through in someone's art
01:18:43 when they've experienced things and this
01:18:46 is
01:18:46 this is what you're getting and this is
01:18:48 what your emotions and all that shit
01:18:51 that that bothers you and freaks you out
01:18:53 and all the chaos
01:18:54 when you get in front of that microphone
01:18:55 that comes out it's almost yeah i guess
01:18:57 your life
01:18:59 is almost like it's kind of art in the
01:19:02 way of kind
01:19:03 i feel like i'm always doing performance
01:19:05 art in some way even in my personal life
01:19:07 that's a problem right
01:19:08 that's good that's scary it's scary it's
01:19:10 hard to be in the moment and just be
01:19:12 you always feel like you're putting on a
01:19:14 show it is well it's because your whole
01:19:15 life you develop putting on a show you
01:19:17 know and we've talked you know obviously
01:19:18 i think a little bit about kind of in
01:19:20 the beginning of this talking about
01:19:21 technology
01:19:22 and how it's changed things for me and
01:19:23 streaming and all these things but it's
01:19:25 also given everyone a voice
01:19:26 yeah the people that don't need one
01:19:28 sometimes to say the things that they
01:19:30 they say it gives them a lot of power
01:19:32 and you've got to have a lot of
01:19:34 restraints like
01:19:35 listen you're sitting with someone that
01:19:36 loves to do drugs i can't take drugs
01:19:38 anymore i want to but because there's a
01:19:39 repercussion i won't
01:19:41 that's the same way i feel about looking
01:19:43 at shit and
01:19:44 looking at daily mail and looking at
01:19:45 these things i i won't do it not because
01:19:48 it's not tempting because in a way that
01:19:50 gives you a rush too right you look at
01:19:51 it you get those adrenalines and the
01:19:53 butterflies i'm
01:19:54 someone that likes to get high it gets
01:19:55 you high drama so i try not to watch any
01:19:57 dramatic tv
01:19:58 or things like that because i'm also
01:20:00 kind of a parrot
01:20:02 i'm a sponge i never grew out of that
01:20:04 you know kids they hear something they
01:20:05 can do it like i've always been like
01:20:07 that if you show me once i can do it
01:20:08 right now
01:20:09 but that's why i shouldn't watch
01:20:10 dramatic television right well that's
01:20:12 why i always feel weird when girls are
01:20:14 really into those true crime shows about
01:20:15 rape and murder
01:20:18 yeah no it's not jesus christ i don't
01:20:20 think it's really really that healthy
01:20:21 that's why i love rupaul's drag race
01:20:24 it's like nothing really harmful is
01:20:26 gonna come out of just slapping some
01:20:28 wigs on and calling it a day would they
01:20:31 do death drops when a whole other way

01:28:21 love that
01:28:22 um good point it's a really good point
01:28:24 i'm trying to dislike
01:28:25 that needs to be tattooed on my and my
01:28:27 brain well rupaul's also been around a
01:28:29 long time
01:28:30 also a really great thriller all the ups
01:28:33 and downs

01:33:45 dolly
01:33:45 she was about as hot as it was and i
01:33:47 love the way that she created like her
01:33:48 identity too you know she created her
01:33:50 identity from the town whore
01:33:52 yeah that everyone made fun of and she
01:33:53 was like i was looking at him like

01:34:21 like she is just she's just as cool as
01:34:23 it gets i mean i do
01:34:25 think that that's a big reason too that
01:34:27 i've i've been able to not even because
01:34:29 she's gonna be mad but you just don't
01:34:30 want to disappoint dolly well it's just
01:34:32 you are very fortunate to be connected
01:34:34 to this like
01:34:35 this lineage you know the fact that you
01:34:38 know you're you're tight with dolly
01:34:40 fucking
01:34:40 pardon like if you're a young country
01:34:42 singer a man
01:34:43 and you know willie nelson holy shit
01:34:45 yeah like you tight with willy like
01:34:47 you gotta you gotta cultivate that
01:34:49 relationship that was kind of my dad
01:34:50 with george jones that's who i grew up
01:34:52 around my whole life like
01:34:53 george was my dad's right hand it was
01:34:56 really painful for him when
01:34:57 he died because that was my dad's just
01:34:59 stake in the grass you know
01:35:01 yeah for sure yeah that's there's
01:35:03 something about that right like this
01:35:05 old guard that like nurtures the young
01:35:08 people coming up
01:35:09 yeah that really i really wanna i wanna
01:35:11 be that person if i if i make it through
01:35:13 the treacherous pathways
01:35:15 you're gonna make it you know i think i
01:35:16 think so if anybody's gonna make it
01:35:18 that's gone through what you've
01:35:19 you've gone through the way you're
01:35:20 looking at it is look it ain't easy kid
01:35:23 but you can do it you can do it well i
01:35:26 would want to be that way with the next
01:35:27 artist and i still
01:35:28 am like even from my position i never
01:35:31 like to see
01:35:31 say or seem like i think i know
01:35:34 something that a new artist doesn't but
01:35:36 i've been doing it now 15 years my show
01:35:38 came out when i was 12 i'm 27
01:35:40 gonna be 28 in a month it's not even
01:35:42 about whether or not you know something
01:35:44 that they don't
01:35:45 it's just what you know it's just it's
01:35:47 what it is
01:35:48 irrelevant it's what you know and i just
01:35:51 feel like
01:35:52 it's kind of you know i never knew
01:35:54 jealousy or competition
01:35:56 through dolly through joan through
01:35:57 stevie that's why when i reach out to
01:35:59 stevie she says like i know that this
01:36:00 corona thing's going on but can we sit
01:36:02 six feet apart in my backyard and talk i
01:36:04 just want to be there for you
01:36:05 that's what she wrote last time you know
01:36:06 and it's like going through what i'm
01:36:08 kind of been going through over the last
01:36:10 two years all these i think honestly
01:36:11 some of the physical pain is growing
01:36:13 pains
01:36:13 you know like i feel like some of the
01:36:15 growth that i've had stress
01:36:17 stress and sure and and quickly just
01:36:20 stretching like
01:36:21 beyond mm-hmm beyond you know and
01:36:25 i just but just a little lack of being
01:36:28 stable like in your mind and the tension
01:36:31 that stuff manifests itself in back
01:36:33 injuries all the time
01:36:35 people always have weird back pains that
01:36:37 are related to just
01:36:38 their life being all fucked up yeah you
01:36:40 just you just you're
01:36:41 always tense yeah i i am i know like my
01:36:44 back cracks like crazy everything you
01:36:47 know down to
01:36:48 when i'm asked what hurts i literally
01:36:50 feel embarrassed to say from the
01:36:51 end of my toe to the top of my head
01:36:53 pretty much hurts a lot of the time
01:36:55 but i'm working on that pain management
01:36:57 and i do like cbd
01:36:58 cbd is awesome yeah i love cbd it's
01:37:00 gigantic i love it yeah but i freak
01:37:02 like for you i can't say this enough you
01:37:04 need rigorous exercise
01:37:06 you need something like really hard so
01:37:07 when it's done you're fucking spent
01:37:10 yeah like yeah just laying on the ground
01:37:13 can't breathe puddle of sweat that type
01:37:15 of shit exercise the demons
01:37:17 i have a seven month uh german shepherd
01:37:19 at home so that seems like a good if
01:37:21 anyone's gonna run me partner that's
01:37:23 who's gonna put me through it so but you
01:37:24 need someone to go that's a good idea to
01:37:25 push you you need to
01:37:26 you need to purge the demons you got
01:37:28 demons yeah
01:37:29 yeah they're in there 100 but again
01:37:32 like you don't want to you kind of hold
01:37:34 on to them a little bit
01:37:36 because i like to use them to my
01:37:37 advantage sometimes music man there's
01:37:39 something about the demons that come out
01:37:40 in the music
01:37:42 there's i mean look that's always why
01:37:45 the the great artist like the thing
01:37:47 about robert johnson right they even
01:37:49 thought he sold his soul
01:37:51 to learn how to play blues the way he
01:37:52 did and it's
01:37:54 because it's because of this the fucking
01:37:56 life experience
01:37:57 came out in his music yeah you need both
01:38:00 of the you can't be some person who just
01:38:02 lives in a fucking monastery and
01:38:04 breathes in and breathes out all day and
01:38:05 then put out amazing art yeah
01:38:07 you have to have pain and light i know
01:38:08 that and i think that's you know i guess
01:38:10 one of our words we've used pretty
01:38:12 consistently today is balance
01:38:14 yeah i think that's pretty much got to
01:38:16 be my mantra yeah
01:38:17 well for you i mean you are
01:38:20 you're you are born into this
01:38:22 treacherous path you have this crazy
01:38:24 position
01:38:25 that you find yourself thrust into where
01:38:26 you're very famous at a very early age
01:38:29 and also there's also there's these
01:38:31 weird expectations because you're famous
01:38:32 for a disney show
01:38:34 right which is even crazier and then
01:38:36 post disney show
01:38:38 erased by craziness and wild and for you
01:38:41 know being a provocateur
01:38:42 and so now i feel like i'm breaking out
01:38:44 of like another role in a way
01:38:46 you know you're becoming just yourself
01:38:49 instead of a rebellious person who's
01:38:51 trying to escape the
01:38:52 the sort of the boundaries of your
01:38:55 persona
01:38:55 yeah well that's why i wanted you know i
01:38:57 haven't in my music video i have me with
01:39:00 the microphone with the microphone stand
01:39:02 and the reason why that was so important
01:39:03 was like i'm not just fucking
01:39:05 getting naked anymore and swinging
01:39:07 around this it's about the music comes
01:39:09 first and i feel like
01:39:10 i think people are very visual and if
01:39:12 you can hold the fucking microphone in
01:39:14 your hand and say this is who i am
01:39:16 this comes first by the way i don't come
01:39:18 without this
01:39:19 like at the vmas they try to get me to
01:39:21 get rid of my microphone
01:39:22 for something that i'm gonna be doing
01:39:24 and i said fuck no
01:39:25 like what do you think i i i can't be
01:39:27 britney spears with the headset and the
01:39:28 snake what's important i don't want the
01:39:30 snake i
01:39:31 i don't want the gag um you know and
01:39:33 there was actually even some comments
01:39:35 that day about
01:39:36 um it was just an interesting
01:39:38 conversation in regards to lighting
01:39:40 because i've been kind of
01:39:42 learning a lot you know from directors i
01:39:43 didn't go to film school but i have been
01:39:45 put through that in that way so i
01:39:47 directed the last video and that's what
01:39:48 i look forward to doing in the next like
01:39:49 10 years i'd love to write and direct
01:39:51 and you know kind of work on film in
01:39:53 that way and
01:39:54 so now i have a better understanding of
01:39:55 cameras and lighting operation and so i
01:39:57 was just asking
01:39:58 some questions about not even on some
01:40:00 diva shit like i only want to get shot
01:40:01 from the side whatever i wanted the
01:40:03 lights to be turned off and that
01:40:05 uh the lighting of the of the room to be
01:40:08 just
01:40:08 lighting me so no key light no beauty
01:40:10 light and beauty light is
01:40:11 always used on women and i said turn the
01:40:13 fucking lights off you would never tell
01:40:15 travis scott or adam levine that he
01:40:17 couldn't turn the beauty light off i
01:40:19 want this red lighting
01:40:20 they said okay okay we'll do it you know
01:40:22 what the same thing that we do with the
01:40:23 guys because
01:40:24 that's what i want and then something
01:40:26 that i was doing which i can't say but
01:40:27 something that i was doing for the vmas
01:40:30 my bracelets kept getting caught in all
01:40:31 the shit and they said you know you want
01:40:33 to be treated like a guy and lit like a
01:40:34 guy we wouldn't be dealing
01:40:35 with this if a guy was doing it and i
01:40:37 said well a guy wouldn't be doing this
01:40:39 because a guy doesn't sell your show
01:40:40 with sex the way that i'm going to
01:40:42 and i and i'm aware of that i know about
01:40:45 these conversations with him i had this
01:40:46 conversation with the directors talking
01:40:48 to me that's a
01:40:49 comment it's a ridiculous conversation
01:40:50 also embarrassing um
01:40:52 uh because this any the conversation
01:40:55 once you
01:40:55 see what happens on the show you'll
01:40:56 understand more um
01:40:59 if you see it but it might be hard not
01:41:01 to you know if you take walks like i do
01:41:03 you might see it whether you want to or
01:41:04 not
01:41:05 if you take walks if you walk down the
01:41:07 street and there's i don't know
01:41:08 maybe people sell magazines i don't know
01:41:09 about it you'll you'll see it at some
01:41:12 point you guys
01:41:13 he'll show me uh so yes and so so
01:41:15 they're
01:41:16 asking a lot of questions about that and
01:41:17 you know like
01:41:19 well how long is glam going to take and
01:41:21 all this stuff and i was like
01:41:22 i mean i can't really nail in enough too
01:41:24 it's like i did come from the world of
01:41:26 dolly parton and i love
01:41:27 pop culture for entertainment and
01:41:28 escapism and again you know we're joking
01:41:31 about the hoodie conversation but i mean
01:41:33 like you know for me i
01:41:34 i there's nights where i don't do that
01:41:36 you know at chris cornell i had on a
01:41:37 pair of black pants and a
01:41:38 fucking chris cornell t-shirt that's
01:41:40 what it was right the vmas is a pop
01:41:42 culture show celebrating pop culture
01:41:44 and i wanted to bring especially in this
01:41:46 time of you know coveted 19 all these
01:41:48 at-home performances like
01:41:49 i want to give my fans escapism good old
01:41:52 pop culture
01:41:53 this is surrealism how hard is it to
01:41:55 deal with people that are directing you
01:41:57 like that
01:41:57 how hard is it to deal with like other
01:41:59 people and their vision and their
01:42:00 talking and their this and their that
01:42:02 when you are just trying to get out
01:42:04 what's in your head
01:42:05 and what your your vision is you're
01:42:07 getting it done you can
01:42:08 get it done but i the my two
01:42:11 the balance that i found is firm and
01:42:14 kind i don't lose my kindness
01:42:16 but i also don't become a mat but i am
01:42:18 firm about what i want
01:42:20 but in a way that you know you might
01:42:22 expect someone might say man she was a
01:42:24 diva she was a bitch but it's again it's
01:42:25 like okay like have the weekend come in
01:42:27 here and say the same thing and you
01:42:28 would say
01:42:28 him you know or kanye is like a creative
01:42:30 god and it's like come on why am i not
01:42:32 getting
01:42:33 that i'm like you know a creative
01:42:35 mastermind but i'm becau
01:42:37 becoming a bitch it's like no one would
01:42:39 ever say that about kanye west choosing
01:42:41 what lighting he wants on a performance
01:42:42 yeah it's such a delicate balance too
01:42:44 right because when someone's as popular
01:42:45 as you like you kind of you know what
01:42:47 the fuck you want to do like
01:42:49 and if this person who you're using as a
01:42:51 director if you don't have a deep
01:42:52 relationship with them
01:42:54 that's why i started directing my own
01:42:55 shit yeah um and that's why i loved
01:42:57 making my last videos so much and
01:42:58 directing it was because
01:43:01 one i thought about my scenes almost
01:43:03 like a relationship you're having a
01:43:05 relationship with it when it's over it's
01:43:06 over
01:43:07 the what's painful isn't the
01:43:09 relationship it's that when it's done
01:43:11 you holding on for that extra however
01:43:13 long you
01:43:14 try to make it work something that's not
01:43:15 working that's what i did on the video
01:43:17 and that's what i hated when i was a kid
01:43:19 you know from directors not knowing what
01:43:21 they want and then getting frustrated
01:43:22 with the child for not performing
01:43:24 properly it's like but you're not
01:43:25 communicating and i'm a child
01:43:28 and you're an adult and you're not
01:43:30 communicating properly so you're working
01:43:32 me into the ground
01:43:33 to get something that you don't know
01:43:35 what you want um
01:43:36 and that was always really frustrating
01:43:38 to me and i think that's why now and
01:43:39 non-negotiable in my relationship or
01:43:41 dating life is you better know what you
01:43:43 want
01:43:44 um because i i'm just not interested in
01:43:46 taking you know another 10 years like i
01:43:48 did with my first love figuring that out
01:43:50 now when you were doing these like when
01:43:53 you're putting together music
01:43:55 do you have anybody that like if you're
01:43:57 doing an album or you have a song
01:43:59 do you do you collaborate with people
01:44:01 would you write the songs entirely on
01:44:03 your own
01:44:03 and bring them to other musicians like
01:44:05 how do you construct something it's been
01:44:06 different so on bangers
01:44:08 which i kind of think my career is like
01:44:09 a as a solo artist i guess kind of
01:44:12 started there i mean i mean not really
01:44:13 when i
01:44:14 when i started working you know on my
01:44:16 very first record um
01:44:17 and it was called breakout and it was
01:44:19 because i was kind of breaking out of
01:44:21 the
01:44:21 character how long ago was this like
01:44:24 2007
01:44:25 i guess maybe something like that crazy
01:44:27 2013 years ago holy shit
01:44:29 2007. i already had two records out
01:44:32 already but they were as hannah you are
01:44:33 14 i'm 27 yeah that's
01:44:37 bananas yeah okay so when you're you're
01:44:39 on hannah montana and i already had two
01:44:41 albums that were like number one and had
01:44:42 done all the things and so then i had
01:44:44 this like how much were you working
01:44:45 pressure
01:44:46 every single day every sunday too sunday
01:44:48 every
01:44:49 sunday because i want to jesus christ
01:44:51 sunday because i wanted to
01:44:52 all day i remember one time i came home
01:44:54 and my dad almost didn't let me go back
01:44:55 on the road because i was so thin
01:44:57 um and he was like what have you been
01:44:59 eating i'm like turkey cheese glasses
01:45:01 you know and he's like who's taking care
01:45:03 of you when you're on the road if it's
01:45:04 not your dad
01:45:05 my grandma my grandma my mom my mom uh
01:45:08 my mom has been my like my mom is the
01:45:11 reason i'm sitting here
01:45:12 so your mom and your grandma would come
01:45:14 with you on the road
01:45:16 and you would just go town to town arena
01:45:18 to arena
01:45:19 boom boom boom boom boom yeah sleep wake
01:45:23 up there you go here's the mic
01:45:24 you look beautiful go to school school i
01:45:27 did school the fuck

01:45:29 teacher on the road with me who's like
01:45:31 jesus was
01:45:32 the best who i loved i loved it but no
01:45:34 kids
01:45:35 what do you mean no no no friends no
01:45:37 other kids just my little sister and my
01:45:38 little brother
01:45:39 how weird is that that was pretty weird
01:45:41 it made me it made
01:45:43 my sister's life a little difficult also
01:45:45 because her idea of like success is
01:45:47 completely blown out of proportion also
01:45:48 oh yeah
01:45:49 she fought and my brother too but my
01:45:51 brother is very simple and i love him so
01:45:53 much and he'll probably be listening to
01:45:54 this and my brother
01:45:56 just has his chickens and his ducks and
01:45:57 he's in nashville and he's in you know
01:46:00 small little place and and he's living
01:46:02 more
01:46:03 i i sometimes wonder if he's the
01:46:05 smartest of us all
01:46:06 i don't know maybe he has less stress he
01:46:08 has less stress yeah
01:46:10 um but he's also a fucking badass talent
01:46:14 but he just saves it
01:46:15 he doesn't want to be on that level like
01:46:17 he wants to make music because he loves
01:46:19 it he wants the people that are
01:46:20 interested in him to hear it
01:46:21 he doesn't have the i gotta grind tell
01:46:23 him see how some shit that's online

01:47:21 exactly it can go one way or the other
01:47:23 right you either become my little sister
01:47:24 who kind of wants it

01:47:41 road she has a song
01:47:43 where she says um my sister's like
01:47:46 sunshine and it'll follow her wherever
01:47:48 she goes but i'm more like a rain cloud
01:47:50 you know it's like she's really got this
01:47:52 idea of me
01:47:53 um like she needs to go to the doctor
01:47:56 she is
01:47:56 we're all at the doctor a lot we we have
01:47:59 like a salary
01:48:00 doctor that's just oh boy we gotta deal
01:48:02 with that yeah she's she's dealing with
01:48:03 it she's dealing with it but she's only
01:48:05 20. so
01:48:05 i i worry about the hardest age for kids
01:48:08 today too
01:48:09 it's so hard dude if you don't look like
01:48:11 these girls on instagram right
01:48:13 they don't even look like these guys you
01:48:15 want to see something crazy yeah i do
01:48:16 my 10 ten-year-old did we were in uh a
01:48:18 restaurant she took a picture of me
01:48:20 my 10 year old thinks it's fucking
01:48:21 hilarious when she does this
01:48:23 she um you know where it is jamie right
01:48:26 that
01:48:26 he'll put it up on the screen she took a
01:48:28 picture of me and she
01:48:30 she goes let me take a picture you make
01:48:31 a face i want like i meant like just
01:48:34 crazy kissy face and then she put it
01:48:36 through this filter that's me
01:48:37 no yes that's not real that's real
01:48:40 that's me
01:48:41 that's me through that's not real yeah
01:48:43 that's me that are you fucking
01:48:45 that's how bad these goddamn filters are
01:48:47 what's wrong with your i don't know
01:48:48 what's happening with that okay so
01:48:49 that's the original picture
01:48:51 right that's me and her at a restaurant
01:48:53 and that's what it came what came out
01:48:56 and meanwhile if you know my 10 year old

01:48:59 so funny she's like
01:49:00 that's that's not right that is how
01:49:02 fucked up these goddamn filters are how
01:49:04 does she do that
01:49:05 it's just a filter and an app that's why
01:49:07 these girls are so insecure
01:49:09 because they think all these people that
01:49:10 they see online are perfect
01:49:12 but every one of those bitches is using
01:49:14 filters all of them
01:49:16 all of them all of them and even people
01:49:18 that i'm friends with
01:49:20 that contacted me like this is crazy
01:49:22 like i use filters but that fuck that's
01:49:23 fucking
01:49:24 i don't have a filter on my phone and i
01:49:25 need to know though what your doctor's
01:49:27 using
01:49:28 like i don't even understand this
01:49:29 technology it's trick
01:49:31 it's witchcraft it's fucking trickery
01:49:32 yeah i've never
01:49:34 i couldn't believe that was really the
01:49:35 only thing i have on my phone is where i
01:49:37 can swipe
01:49:37 on uh the instagram story thingy and
01:49:40 turn paris
01:49:41 you know where it kind of blurs out your
01:49:43 pores or something that's all i got
01:49:45 don't even use that it's ridiculous it
01:49:47 looks pretty good no you look great you
01:49:48 don't need that shit
01:49:49 no it makes you look like a cartoon he
01:49:51 doesn't make it i don't do any of this
01:49:53 shit with like girls want that
01:49:54 they want like no flaws they want
01:49:56 everything to be like cloudy
01:49:58 yeah i don't know that's basically what
01:49:59 it does it makes you look like but
01:50:01 that's
01:50:01 not good i know i know there's so much
01:50:03 unprogramming to do on me
01:50:05 so much on everybody there's so much
01:50:07 time programming it's all these women
01:50:08 out there that are
01:50:09 they're these unrealistic expectations
01:50:12 like i'm sure you saw that khloe
01:50:13 kardashian picture that looks nothing
01:50:14 like her
01:50:15 where it like goes from like the
01:50:17 hairlines like
01:50:18 yeah nonsense they did they used they
01:50:20 used photoshop on her i mean it's like
01:50:22 cgi
01:50:24 you might as well be looking at a
01:50:25 monster movie like when she turns into a
01:50:26 werewolf it's not what that's not who
01:50:28 she is
01:50:28 no it's crazy i mean and even like for
01:50:30 me i think
01:50:31 you know in my real life i don't wear
01:50:33 any makeup i don't even like today
01:50:35 someone asked me like what do you use on
01:50:36 your hair and i'm like shampoo and
01:50:37 conditioner like i don't do anything to
01:50:39 my hair i don't really do anything
01:50:41 and that's been really fucking tough for
01:50:43 me over the last few months too because
01:50:44 i don't know why i guess i i
01:50:46 i think as that keeps happening like as
01:50:48 these technology things keep happening
01:50:50 on instagram these filters keep getting
01:50:51 better and better
01:50:52 i'm compared to the people altering
01:50:56 you know themselves either physically
01:50:58 like with all these
01:51:00 things you can do and lasers and all the
01:51:02 shit or to the filters and i've had a
01:51:04 really hard time with that you know and
01:51:05 i think
01:51:06 um it's hard for me the other day you
01:51:08 know i get packed walking around my
01:51:09 neighborhood in like a really shitty
01:51:10 dirty
01:51:11 fleetwood mac t-shirt that i've been in
01:51:13 for five days
01:51:14 and it hurts just don't go online
01:51:17 just just detox from all that shit no
01:51:20 why don't i
01:51:20 be ray just don't pay attention to all
01:51:22 these other women that are doing these
01:51:24 fucking wacky filters because that's
01:51:26 where everybody gets fucked up it's the
01:51:28 comparison thing
01:51:29 there's a book called the coddling of
01:51:31 the american mind
01:51:32 by jonathan height and he talks about
01:51:34 young girls and depression
01:51:36 yes gigantic uptick in depression that
01:51:39 directly coincides with the invention of
01:51:40 the iphone
01:51:42 and that as the iphone came up and then
01:51:44 pictures and then
01:51:45 social media apps so at first it was a
01:51:48 lot of it was social media
01:51:50 and people being mean to each other on
01:51:52 twitter and all those things because
01:51:53 you're not seeing each other
01:51:55 there's not a lot about this about the
01:51:57 iphone kind of i guess
01:51:58 mimicking right vegas uh slot machines
01:52:02 and things oh yeah
01:52:03 like there's it's actually isn't it i
01:52:05 think it was called what i listen to is
01:52:07 the slot machine in your pocket
01:52:08 yeah well it is a lot like that but the
01:52:10 thing about it with women in particular
01:52:12 with young girls
01:52:14 is that they're comparing themselves to
01:52:16 these cartoons
01:52:17 these people that aren't even like that
01:52:18 picture of me you know when i got sober
01:52:20 i had to delete all the apps
01:52:22 on my phone where i could purchase
01:52:24 things like i had to take off amazon and
01:52:26 all the things on my phone because
01:52:27 walking around with that slot machine in
01:52:29 my pocket all of a sudden i'm getting
01:52:30 these bills and things and
01:52:32 and yes i care about that and i want to
01:52:34 live financially
01:52:35 responsibly and all the things and i'm
01:52:38 looking at this i'm like i don't even
01:52:39 remember doing this like it's totally
01:52:40 like being high on drugs
01:52:42 it is and things started showing up and
01:52:44 you're like what the hell it's too easy
01:52:46 i'm in the middle of a book now about
01:52:48 that it's called irresistible
01:52:50 you find that it's on my instagram too
01:52:53 jamie
01:52:53 um irresistible is this book that is
01:52:56 about how people are addicted
01:52:58 it's by uh adam alter and uh it's about
01:53:02 how people are addicted
01:53:04 to your phones and applications but it
01:53:07 also goes into
01:53:08 just the actual physical aspect of
01:53:11 addiction and how it works on the brain
01:53:12 and how we always like to think of
01:53:14 addiction as like it's something that
01:53:15 you get hooked physically and you can't
01:53:17 live without it
01:53:18 no it's something that you have a
01:53:20 compulsion to to use
01:53:22 and you can't avoid that compulsion for
01:53:25 some reason and it doesn't even
01:53:26 necessarily have to be good
01:53:28 no and it can happen it can happen with
01:53:29 things like love
01:53:31 and i mean i've even felt that too when
01:53:33 it's like
01:53:34 in the most stressful times of my life
01:53:36 it's like okay i can't reach for drugs
01:53:37 anymore okay i don't want to reach for
01:53:38 bad food all right i'm going to reach
01:53:39 for someone to love me and it's like you
01:53:41 know coming down from something all the
01:53:43 time
01:53:45 part of love is the most powerful drug
01:53:47 you're ever going to take it's like
01:53:48 cocaine when you yeah it's dopamine
01:53:50 straight dopamine right to the fucking v
01:53:51 dr amon has a book brain in love and
01:53:53 i've
01:53:54 read it a lot because i had a tendency
01:53:56 to to need someone in my life at all
01:53:59 times and i
01:53:59 actually now i i really love just
01:54:01 factual information so you can go i'm
01:54:03 not a total
01:54:04 freak that's got this a d i'm not a love
01:54:06 addict this is actually
01:54:08 what is happening to me on a level of
01:54:10 this is uncontrollable
01:54:12 of you can control how it affects you
01:54:14 and what you're
01:54:15 i guess you kind of learn to control
01:54:18 your reaction exactly you can control
01:54:19 your reaction
01:54:20 but when you love someone the first
01:54:22 couple of months
01:54:24 you know you do feel like you're high on
01:54:25 drugs it is it is it's the same
01:54:27 it's the same drip it really is it's
01:54:30 dopamine
01:54:32 he writes how it kind of goes from like
01:54:33 more like cocaine which is kind of a
01:54:35 quick hit and
01:54:36 wears off really quickly so you need a
01:54:37 lot of it and then it becomes more like
01:54:39 you know kind of like heroin where it's
01:54:41 something that almost sues you actually
01:54:42 i i i
01:54:44 called the the love of mine who i was
01:54:46 with and we got divorced it was almost
01:54:48 like a pacifier
01:54:49 like it was that thing that i just
01:54:50 needed not because we were in love
01:54:52 anymore
01:54:53 but because of the comfort and cause my
01:54:54 brain said oh this feels better this is
01:54:56 comforting
01:54:57 but actually knowing that i was giving
01:54:59 in to an addiction made me feel
01:55:01 way worse i had the hangover next day
01:55:04 okay we sleep together next day we wake
01:55:05 up
01:55:06 i'm totally hungover yeah you know it
01:55:08 felt like a relapse every time i go back
01:55:10 well people do it to each other you know
01:55:11 it's not even anybody's fault it's like
01:55:13 you you don't even realize that you're a
01:55:14 part of this drug cycle
01:55:16 yeah and then you get involved in that
01:55:18 and then you find some new person and
01:55:20 you get lit up
01:55:21 yeah maybe some new person you see at
01:55:22 the gym or at the office or wherever you
01:55:24 meet people and you're like
01:55:25 well what's funny what's funny about
01:55:27 this is like you know i guess i just
01:55:29 realized something about myself is
01:55:32 all of a sudden it's like unavoidable
01:55:33 you know i'm telling you this is not
01:55:35 true so this is where i now retract what
01:55:37 i've said because i
01:55:38 i need to i need to work on this a
01:55:40 little bit so it's like okay it's so
01:55:41 untrue for me to see all these bad
01:55:43 things they're in my face no matter what
01:55:44 no matter what i want to look at or not
01:55:46 i have a really hard time looking at the
01:55:48 good things like when people send me the
01:55:49 stats of my song i don't open it
01:55:51 when people send me the charts or the
01:55:53 views i don't open it because i don't
01:55:54 want to get attached to success or
01:55:56 numbers or
01:55:57 mean that my art everyone said literally
01:55:59 i'll show you the text manager he said
01:56:01 unless it's a drag queen death dropping
01:56:03 to her new single don't even bother
01:56:04 sending it to her because she's not
01:56:05 going to open it
01:56:06 and i think that's good that's a sign of
01:56:08 you avoiding narcissism but i wonder why
01:56:10 i feel like
01:56:11 i can avoid i can't avoid the bad things
01:56:14 and looking at them like i'm
01:56:15 maybe a little addiction of that of
01:56:17 looking at that but then
01:56:19 why don't i want the hit of the
01:56:20 positivity of like seeing the numbers
01:56:23 because you want to work hard because
01:56:25 you want things to be difficult when you
01:56:26 see too much success you don't want to
01:56:28 slack off i have no idea how many people
01:56:30 listen to my song i have the same thing
01:56:32 yeah i can't have the same thing i have
01:56:33 the same thing with podcasts or the same
01:56:34 thing with comedy specials i don't
01:56:36 read any of their reviews i just keep
01:56:37 moving that's what i don't always do
01:56:39 that
01:56:39 and everyone's like you want to hear
01:56:40 some stats i'm like i literally you can
01:56:42 ask them i say i won't even know what it
01:56:43 means jamie will tell me some stats
01:56:45 every now and then
01:56:46 and i'll just go what the fuck means
01:56:48 yeah
01:56:49 it's well it gets nuts yeah i don't know
01:56:51 what it means yeah what does it mean and
01:56:52 a lot of the three million streams
01:56:54 what does that mean in the world of like
01:56:55 how many seven billion
01:56:57 it's never good enough for me it doesn't
01:56:58 mean like three million seven billion
01:57:00 i could do better right exactly yeah
01:57:02 three million is not enough
01:57:03 well that's i think that's a sign that
01:57:06 you're looking at things the right way i
01:57:08 really do because i think that's a sign
01:57:09 of you
01:57:10 you know what you were talking about
01:57:11 earlier you want to struggle you want to
01:57:14 you want to earn it you know because you
01:57:16 think that you kind of got
01:57:17 these crazy gifts being famous at a
01:57:19 young age and all this wealth and
01:57:21 success at a young age you want to earn
01:57:22 it so when you see success and the
01:57:24 trappings of success or
01:57:26 wallowing around in all of your fortune
01:57:28 you don't want to do that
01:57:29 you want to hustle you want to keep
01:57:30 going i think that's a good sign yeah
01:57:32 i really do yeah yeah that's why yeah at
01:57:34 some point
01:57:36 you know you can bring your kids maybe
01:57:38 she can do that weird fucked up thing to
01:57:40 my face whatever you should come and see
01:57:42 some of the animals especially
01:57:43 in your nashville i think you'll totally
01:57:45 get it i think you'll totally get if
01:57:46 you're ever in tennessee and you come
01:57:48 out to the farm and you see the horses
01:57:49 and you see the pigs bite my ankles and
01:57:51 all these things i'm sure
01:57:52 i think i think you'll you'll get a
01:57:53 really good balance good understanding
01:57:55 of my life and who i am
01:57:57 my last comedy special that i filmed uh
01:57:59 was strange times for netflix
01:58:01 and when i was when i warm up for shows
01:58:04 i've done all the work
01:58:05 i like to just put my brain in another
01:58:07 place and i was listening to malibu
01:58:11 and that's that's what i thought you're
01:58:13 going to say all the people
01:58:14 on the set were making fun of me so my
01:58:17 friend anthony giordano who also directs
01:58:19 the ufc by the way yeah because he's
01:58:21 imagining a good friend of mine
01:58:22 he's like what are you listening to i go
01:58:24 miley cyrus and like he's like shut the
01:58:25 fuck up i go look i go listen to it i
01:58:27 put the headsets on him and i had him
01:58:29 listen to it but that song is so
01:58:31 removed from anything in me or or my
01:58:34 life and i love your voice
01:58:36 thank you so it's it's a little escape
01:58:37 for me that's cool so i'd be like
01:58:39 dancing backstage
01:58:40 high as fuck getting ready to go on
01:58:42 stage listening to your song yeah
01:58:45 that was the first song well no because
01:58:47 i had done dead pets
01:58:49 uh dead pets was where i started writing
01:58:52 like my
01:58:52 music where if you know you look at the
01:58:54 list it says cause
01:58:56 what's funny okay so if you look at
01:58:57 stevie nick songs things have changed a
01:58:58 lot in
01:58:59 in credits a lot of it says written by
01:59:02 stevie nicks and it doesn't says any
01:59:03 other writers but there are other
01:59:04 writers because there's music that was
01:59:06 written she didn't play every guitar
01:59:07 part and every piano part etc
01:59:09 now it's changed in our credits and the
01:59:11 way we do things so actually you have to
01:59:13 put
01:59:13 written by for anyone that wrote
01:59:16 anything musical on the song so any
01:59:18 guitar parts all that shit
01:59:20 so if you start looking at some of the
01:59:21 dead pet stuff it'll say written by and
01:59:23 they'll say a group of people but all
01:59:24 the lyrics were written by me it's just
01:59:26 any of the
01:59:27 melodic stuff in the track is that all
01:59:28 stuff that's new for
01:59:30 for money purposes yeah and i think the
01:59:32 way that now streaming is kind of making
01:59:34 things a little bit more difficult
01:59:36 because you don't pay someone the way
01:59:37 that you would record when record sales
01:59:38 they get their money whatever so that
01:59:40 it's something to do with that it's very
01:59:41 complex
01:59:42 and they say that some of the best
01:59:43 lawyers don't even understand quite
01:59:44 what's going on in the music industry
01:59:46 right now because we're having such uh
01:59:48 change such a shift in the way that
01:59:49 everything's happening
01:59:50 from sec sales of records of records to
01:59:53 streaming to videos to tick tocks tick
01:59:55 tock is like a freaking label now
01:59:58 so they pay tick-tockers to tick-tock to
02:00:00 your music because it counts as streams
02:00:02 i don't even understand it
02:00:04 i don't even understand it but this is a
02:00:06 thing tick-tock is weird
02:00:07 do you pay attention all that shit with
02:00:09 it's like the chinese government owns it
02:00:11 no it's very i mean i know that that's a
02:00:13 thing i also know that
02:00:15 it was like you know this is the new way
02:00:16 of the new label
02:00:18 basically labels pay tick-tock to be
02:00:21 able to have these kids doing i don't
02:00:22 know if i'm supposed to say it but they
02:00:23 fucking do so then i said it please say
02:00:24 it
02:00:25 that's all i know is like it's true so
02:00:27 say it so they pay
02:00:28 kids to tick-tock to certain so say if
02:00:30 you're a tick-tocker you're like a
02:00:32 big-time teacher there's like rich
02:00:33 tick-tockers that are like
02:00:34 that from like millions i don't know
02:00:36 about millions we have maybe a different
02:00:38 idea of like richie rich but for kids
02:00:40 living in a house here that there's tick
02:00:41 tock agencies yes tick tock
02:00:43 agencies so they like uh marcia i see a
02:00:46 tick tock and
02:00:47 it's like a big big mirror i'm telling
02:00:49 you it's like some fucked up black
02:00:50 mirror shit wow
02:00:51 interesting i didn't but the one thing
02:00:53 that i told the kids that you know
02:00:55 these kind of influencers i've spoken to
02:00:57 some of them before by doing some of
02:00:59 this press you know they
02:01:00 want me to play the song for them
02:01:01 whatever and the one thing that i said
02:01:02 that i like is like at least it's kids
02:01:04 creating content for themselves
02:01:06 because i used that to go through all
02:01:07 the middle men before before i could put
02:01:09 out a fucking video i had to ask
02:01:11 hey gary marsh at disney is this okay
02:01:13 hey this person can i do this
02:01:14 but now it's like shit grab your phone
02:01:16 put it up you're in control of your own
02:01:17 destiny
02:01:18 right you could i mean if you wanted to
02:01:20 you could set your phone up and just go
02:01:22 live on youtube and play an acoustic set
02:01:24 and do whatever the fuck i love that
02:01:26 about that so i love that about today
02:01:29 yeah me too
02:01:29 i love that amazing um and yeah so so
02:01:32 kind of to that point was
02:01:33 when i was working on younger now that
02:01:36 was the first record i was going to put
02:01:37 out that was
02:01:38 for sale because i did soundcloud with
02:01:40 my flaming lips record so because i said
02:01:42 people don't want to hear me singing a
02:01:43 song called bang my box about me
02:01:45 like having sex at a lesbian strip club
02:01:48 well then i'm not going to ask them to
02:01:49 buy it i'm just gonna give it to him as
02:01:50 a gift and you're really the worst thing
02:01:52 they can do with a gift is throw it away
02:01:53 or not open it like
02:01:54 well that's mine good thing of being in
02:01:56 the position where you're in that you
02:01:57 could call the shop
02:01:58 exactly and it's like listen okay you're
02:02:01 not gonna make money off of it's like
02:02:02 hey that's fine
02:02:03 i'm sure they're still selling a
02:02:04 toothbrush somewhere that plays my
02:02:05 fucking song and i'll get a dollar from
02:02:07 that are there any tick tockers out
02:02:09 there to bang my box
02:02:10 i don't think anyone's tick talking to
02:02:12 bang my box jamie can you uh
02:02:14 research that please i do i honestly i
02:02:17 think everything
02:02:18 on the internet's been done but i don't
02:02:19 think people tic-tac-toe
02:02:21 love to see a bunch of rupaul's drag
02:02:23 queens tick-tocking to bang my box
02:02:25 i don't think it's happening my box is
02:02:27 very very niche
02:02:29 we can make that happen i feel like we
02:02:31 could put that out there into the
02:02:32 internet
02:02:36 now i'm trying to find a good version to
02:02:38 show i'm trying to be quick about it
02:02:39 i'm scared well listen jamie can find it
02:02:42 if it's out there
02:02:43 he has connections to the dark
02:02:48 he's the best googler on the planet
02:02:50 there's no one even close
02:02:51 yes he's a one-handed best googler too i
02:02:54 know look at this
02:02:55 he googles with one hand while he's
02:02:56 working the camera together oh my god
02:02:58 let me give you some volume uh let me
02:03:01 hear a little bit look at this guy
02:03:04 so we got um a dude
02:03:07 oh okay there you go look this is how
02:03:10 shit it is it's got two fucking likes
02:03:13 listen for now it has two likes now
02:03:16 people know about it
02:03:17 and now it'll have more influence i'll
02:03:19 retweet that shit later
02:03:20 send that to me and i'll retweet it i
02:03:23 want you to bang my box
02:03:25 the point being is that that was free
02:03:27 and then getting to write younger now
02:03:29 and writing malibu i wrote that in the
02:03:30 back of the car on the way to vo
02:03:31 on the go into the voice because i was
02:03:33 looking outside the window in the car
02:03:34 thinking like
02:03:35 all of it's true like i had never really
02:03:36 gone to the beach the closest i've ever
02:03:38 really gotten was my parents taking me
02:03:39 to florida
02:03:40 like one time and my sister got my toe
02:03:43 caught in the
02:03:44 uh revolving door and like i had to go
02:03:46 to the hospital as a nightmare and my
02:03:47 parents swore would never go on vacation
02:03:48 again but most parents say
02:03:50 don't mean it my parents fucking met it
02:03:51 meant it we never went on vacation again
02:03:53 that's crazy that you did all that work
02:03:55 and you never went on vacation
02:03:56 well i went on my own vacations we
02:03:58 didn't go on a family vacation that song
02:04:00 is so
02:04:01 obviously written by you yeah and that
02:04:03 was one of the things that i think i
02:04:04 liked about it
02:04:04 that it was uh when you listen to
02:04:07 someone sing a song like a really good
02:04:09 song
02:04:10 it's an expression of who they are at
02:04:11 that point in time in their life and you
02:04:13 can get wrapped up in their mind
02:04:14 you know and i felt like that's why i
02:04:17 like listening to other people i like
02:04:18 listening to songs before i go on stage
02:04:20 because it gets me out of my own head
02:04:22 and it gets me into someone else's head
02:04:24 and then when it's time to go you know
02:04:25 and they're like you're on in three like
02:04:27 okay and then i'll take the headphones
02:04:28 off i'll do a shot
02:04:29 i'll stretch out a little and then here
02:04:30 we go that's me oh hell yeah
02:04:32 that is that's me listening to your
02:04:34 fucking song crazy
02:04:35 yeah legit i'm not lying that's nuts
02:04:38 well that's an honor i play that when
02:04:41 anthony was listening to he's like you
02:04:43 fucking idiot what are you listening to
02:04:44 that's fucking wild i never ever ever
02:04:46 would have thought that never would have
02:04:47 thought that
02:04:48 i like it thank you i like your music
02:04:50 thank you and i like you you're a good
02:04:51 person
02:04:52 thank you so much youtube i enjoyed
02:04:53 talking to you i did too i'm glad we did
02:04:55 this i agreed
02:04:56 so um you got something that's out right
02:04:58 now yeah
02:04:59 what is it how do people get it well
02:05:02 uh it's called midnight sky and
02:05:05 even just the title is kind of inspired
02:05:06 by debbie harry's heart of glass but i
02:05:09 pulled inspiration from edges 17 two of
02:05:11 my favorite songs heart of glass the
02:05:12 reason i love it so much is
02:05:14 that the title isn't the repetition in
02:05:16 the chorus
02:05:17 it's just a cool thing to say it's not
02:05:19 the chorus at all
02:05:20 um and so i thought you know what my
02:05:21 favorite part about it is is i love the
02:05:23 the kind of visual painting of midnight
02:05:26 sky and what that means
02:05:28 um and the midnight sky to me is like if
02:05:30 you're really fucking partying
02:05:32 the moon is a disco ball and the stars
02:05:34 are all the reflection of light on the
02:05:35 ceiling
02:05:36 and what i really like about the disco
02:05:38 ball is that it's a bunch of broken
02:05:39 pieces put back together again that when
02:05:41 you're finally enlightened
02:05:43 it makes this mesmerizing totally
02:05:44 attractive like
02:05:46 people it's like you know it's like the
02:05:49 bugs to the light like people love disco
02:05:50 balls but it's really just a bunch of
02:05:52 broken
02:05:52 pieces put together and so i felt like
02:05:54 that was reflective of me
02:05:56 wow pretty deep to think about it that's
02:05:58 heavy yeah that's heavy but when i saw
02:06:00 it i thought like i recognized this
02:06:02 this is what i feel like all right so
02:06:04 that's it what sends it on there and
02:06:06 it's everywhere it's on youtube
02:06:07 streaming and yeah it's everywhere and
02:06:09 i'm making it so hopefully people will
02:06:11 watch it
02:06:11 all right you're a bad motherfucker
02:06:13 thank you thank you thanks bye everybody
02:06:16 cool
02:06:19 i like being in here this is
02:06:31 you
